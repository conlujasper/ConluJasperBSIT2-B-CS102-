","15 October 2019","
            7/10
            ","There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.
What doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.
Another thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.
Also I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.
In conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer."

            ","Arthur Fleck's a guy with lofty aspirations, wants to make you laugh and disturb your foundations, although, he's not really that funny, he ain't going to make much money, so before you start, curtail your expectations; unlike Arthur, you won't be having laughing fits, as he aspires to get some television glitz, dispatches tormentors with glee, it's a substantial, hefty fee, but I guarantee, it won't leave you in bits; although, if schadenfreude's your thing you might just chuckle, but if it's not, the story may just make you buckle, as those on, the lower rungs, tend to not have, that much fun, and quite often, from the day they learned to suckle."

            ","Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife.
Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting.
Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message.
It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too.
The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different.
It's BELIEVABLE.
There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people.
Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film."

            10/10
            ","I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.
It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing."

            ","Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director"

","7 October 2019","
            6/10
            ","Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too. This is Joker's own fantasy origin story, which has little validity.Go ahead and downvote, but there's no way this take on the Joker is intelligent and mentally competent enough to become Ledger's Joker."

            ","Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime"

            ","When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope."

            ","What can I say about it that hasn't already been said? It's not a terrible film, but it's not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it's trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it's not really sure what it's trying to say or if it's even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it's easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I'm not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it's also just not that interesting. It's kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That's a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a ""masterpiece"" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy."

            10/10
            ","In the non-canonical origin story Joker, Joaquin Phoenix plays a deeply disturbed man named Arthur Fleck as he experiences through a series of traumas that turn him into the notorious supervillain.Phoenix is terrific as the agonized loser with a compulsive-laughter condition. He's weird and creepy and full of angst and anger and self-loathing and everyone-else-loathing.The first half hour is simply a grinding, agonizingly slow moving portrayal of Arthur's life. Then there's a moment of stunning, electrifying violence. And then everything gets tedious again.Joker is not a supervillain movie, it's an artsy character study, and if you like those then this might appeal to you. But there's a superficiality to it all. Arthur is deeply disturbed and living in a city where society's have-nots are increasingly disenfranchised, but the script and director don't really seem to have anything to say about mental illness or inequality and injustice.In the run-up to the film, director Todd Phillips criticized ""woke"" culture and the far left, and perhaps that's part of the problem. Woke culture says we need to think about things deeply, and Phillips really, really seem loathe to delve into what it means to be mentally unstable and poor in the greater societal sense. He's only concerned with how it effects Arthur. Arthur is also only concerned with how it effects Arthur, and the result is a film that seems to accept that Arthur is a victim of an unjust society while never really considering why the society is unjust or how much of Arthur's problems might be the result of his own narcissistic self pity.But the main problem with the movie is it's slow-moving and dull far more often than not. I wouldn't recommend it."

            ","While I've watched many of the superhero movies that have come down the pike,
they are often the same. So the compensation for sensational plots involves great special effects and non-stop action. They are fun and I don't mean to dis them. What is missing is a truly psychological drama. We don't get into the heads of the characters. This film is incredible as we watch a man confront his demons. We see him made fun of, attacked, and beaten. When he responds, he is seen as crazy. He also find that he is diminished in the eye of a counselor, and his mother has kept a secret. I thought it gave us a foundation for the Batman mythos without getting to deeply into it. Acting, atmosphere, and a sophisticated plot makes this a really excellent film."

            ","This is probably one of the most successful examples of a gorgeous solo film about some popular character.The Joker was played by the inimitable Joaquin Phoenix (known for his role in Gladiator), and people comparing him to Ledger are very narrow-minded, because Phoenix showed us a completely new Joker, who is gorgeous in his own way.The plot tells about a sick man Arthur, who suffers eternal ridicule over himself, lives and cares for his mother, and also dreams of being accepted by people, thanks to his performance on Murray's favorite humor show (De Niro)
As a result, we will see a man becoming a monster because of our society, of course not without his mental illness, but the nature of people clearly pushed the main character to become a Joker.This is a gorgeous dramatic thriller, with some cool reference for the future (little Bruce, Thomas Wayne, etc.), which is a must-watch!

            7/10
            ","In an era of cinema so saturated with superheroes and gritty remakes, Todd Phillips and Phoenix somehow take a character so deeply intrenched in pop culture and create something compelling and unique. This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary. It came across as pandering to an audience that loves Easter eggs more-so than the story itself. In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story. Other than that, I had little issue with the rest of the film.Joker is a movie that tells us life is full of sadness, and then gives us a character whose purpose is to spread laughter and joy. I was going to finish this review with a joke, but, you wouldn't get it."

Good acting and production values cannot save a script steeped in tiresome stereotypes and a failure to delve into a character's identity. We meet the Joker when already imbalanced and his so-called descent into madness is really a couple weeks away; far from a descent, it's a stroll. This is not a character study, despite claims to the contrary. It's a showcase of a good actor overly contorting his body and laughing manically as a mistaken expression of madness. Where is the past? Where are the influences? Where are the conflicts? What are the seminal moments that create the spiral? Perhaps if he had really had that relationship, and had it gone sour, it would justify a descent. Instead, it's a fait accompli.

            ","I did not expect the sequel to a decent spin-off Dreamworks film from over a decade ago to be one of the most poignant, introspective, genuinely hilarious, and heartwarming films of the year. But here we are.After an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, The Last Wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. The film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.The screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. And it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.What I also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.I adored this film.

            ","""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is as spry and light on its feet as its titular feline. The inherently alluring paradox of the swashbuckling kitty from the ""Shrek"" universe remains firmly in place 11 years after his first solo feature. He's a dashing adventurer, a charmer with the ladies, feared and renowned throughout the land -- but he's also unbearably adorable as he laps up milk from a shot glass with his pinky, sandpapery tongue. As always, the charismatic and sensitive Antonio Banderas finds just the right tone in exploring this furry animated figure's suave and silly sides. ""The Last Wish"" expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the Oscar-nominated 2011 original ""Puss in Boots."" Joining Banderas and his longtime friend and co-star Salma Hayek Pinault are Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and John Mulaney, among many others. They bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor. But of course, the fast-paced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director Joel Crawford and co-director Januel Mercado's film. The film's aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences, especially during the action sequences, but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight. From the moss growing on a fearsome forest giant to the shiny silkiness of Puss' whiskers blowing in the wind, ""The Last Wish"" offers a variety of eye-popping details. And it frequently features dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves to transition from past to present or one scene to the next. But the film also manages to convey messages of selflessness and teamwork in a way that doesn't feel heavy-handed or cloying. And the stellar voice performances and dazzling visuals keep things so engaging you won't need a laser pointer or a catnip-stuffed mouse toy to entertain you."

It works on so many levels: as a high-speed comedy, all the jokes land, but as a story about mortality and the meaning of life, this film is oddly compelling and mature. The plot literally involves Puss running from the personification of death, hoping to cling to his life.

If anyone is considering taking their family to see the Last Wish like I did then The Last Wish is an easy recommendation. 100% worth the money. Two thumbs up for team friendship."

            ","The last ""Puss In Boots"" movie was made 11 years ago, as well as the last film the ""Shrek"" franchise, so surely they couldn't make something really great again, right? The story is pretty standard, as Puss In Boots is down to his last life and tries to get a wish on a magic star. It seriously has some of the best action I've seen in a long time. I don't even think this film qualifies as a comedy. It really is more like a straightforward action flick. Even its first five minutes are nothing but nonstop action from Frame 1 to Frame...whatever.This film does not take place before the Shrek films. We get to see some brief flashbacks with Shrek himself, albeit only for a few seconds. The villains are Big Jack Horner, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and a wolf. I believe a poster called this character the Big Bad Wolf, but he isn't that, even if he's technically based on him (he's actually DEATH). Every one of these villains are unique with their own motivations. Every minute makes me eager to find out what happens next.So...who does get the wish in the end? Nobody! Everyone (except Big Jack Horner) realizes they had what they wanted after awhile. It even begins with another sequel hook with Puss In Boots going back to Far Far Away Land. Another Shrek/Puss In Boots movie? If it has such amazing cel shading animation with the best CGI of all, it deserves as many films as possible! ****"

            ","Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) becomes a popular folk hero in his country. After his latest conquest of a giant monster, he was killed by a freak accident with a church bell. When he woke up, Puss realized that he already spent eight of his nine lives, and that he only had one more life to live. At first he did not think it was a big deal, but a traumatic encounter with a sinister-looking Wolf (Wagner Moura) made Puss decide to retire from adventures.While living the life of a spoiled lazy lap cat, Puss learned about a Wishing Star from the family of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo) who were looking for it. Puss decided to search for the Star himself in order to wish for his nine lives back. Along with Puss on his quest were his old flame Kitty Softpaws (Selma Hayek) and a nameless little orphan therapy dog (Harvey Guillen).This sequel to the first ""Puss in Boots"" solo spin-off movie came out 11 years after the original. There is a very evident difference that can be noted in the style of its animation. On top of the 3D computer-generated images of the characters, there is now an additional 2D artistic style as if they were hand-painted (first seen in ""The Bad Guys""), especially noted most prominently in the character of the Wolf, and even in Puss during their showdown fight scenes.The voice work of the actors really captured the personalities of the characters. Antonio Banderas's voice had the bravado, arrogance and charisma of Puss, whom we've known and loved since he made his first appearance in ""Shrek 2"" (2004). Selma Hayek lends her sexy sassiness to the voice of the skillful thief Kitty Softpaws, who held a grudge against Puss. Florence Pugh's characteristic raspiness was easily recognizable in Goldilocks's voice.Like before, the characters Puss encounters were all fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters. The choice for main antagonist was Jack Horner, the boy who sat in the corner eating his pies, but he was not little here anymore. He was not as famous as others, so some kids may need a review of his rhyme to refamiliarize. There were a trove of Disney character references you'll have fun identifying, from Mary Poppins, Alice in Wonderland and Jiminy Cricket.Very notable in this latest Dreamworks release is the darkness of the plot, which was also reflected in the artwork styles and situations depicted. Only in trickles, but this must be the first time blood was seen in a Dreamworks animated film. The language and humor used was also more mature, even with some assumed expletives bleeped out. As the topic of death played a major part in the story, scenes with the Wolf can be very scary for little kids. 8/10.PS: The new DreamWorks Animation opening logo precedes this film. It was quite nostalgic to see the DreamWorks boy seeing famous DreamWorks characters old an new -- like Toothless, Po, Boss Baby, a Troll, the Bad Guys and of course, Shrek with Fiona and Donkey -- as his crescent moon flew him around in space before settling in its place."

            ","This is genuinely one of my favorite films of the year. I hope it gets real recognition and people don't dismiss it as ""just an animated film"".I've always liked DreamWorks films, with my favorite being How to Train Your Dragon 2, but after rewatching the first Puss in Boots movie, I wasn't expecting much for this sequel, eleven years after. I like the first installment for sure but it's certainly a lot simpler in story than I'd prefer. This one however, has such a rich emotional aspect to it that I truly felt something during it.There were also certain scenes involving a wolf character that were quite creepy. I think kids will have a lot of fun with this movie, but at the core this is a story about family and understanding the value of things and/or people who are in front of you already. And that's a message that every person of any age can get something out of. The voice acting is top-notch and the animation is such a ridiculous step-up from the last time. This is such a cool direction to take this sequel into and I dug it all the way through.There's really not much negative to say other than the ending feels like it should have been slightly more concise, but that's it. I loved it and I'll rewatch it as soon as it releases on VOD."

            ","I did not have many expectations going into this with my daughter, I've seen the main Shrek movies but noon of the other Puss in Boot's spin-offs. I was shocked at how good a movie this was when the credits rolled!The story itself is functional, but all characters are given meaningful and relatable arcs. Between the melanchonic Puss reaching the end of his days as a great hero, his always positive dog sidekick and the 3 antagonistic parties trying to reach the magical macguffin there is a lot going on and none of it feels forced in.The two greatest assets the movie brings is it's humor and the stunning action scenes. First of all, this movie has bite, it is back to the tone of the first Shrek movie with lots of jokes that are working on a children and adult level of understanding. While the story is easy to follow for kids, the themes explored are relatively mature and will keep adults engaged.Secondly, while Disney/Pixar movies lately fail to make action exiting with their polished CGI style, Puss in boots goes full Into the Spiderverse once a fight breaks out. Glorious 12 frames per second, hyper stylized with all the filters and gimmicks necessary to elevate the big set-pieces to something truly special and memorable. Especially Puss's duels against a mysterious bounty hunter are the highlights.While not entirely original, the Puss in Boots: The Last Wish combines the edgy humor of Shrek with the visual wonders of Into the Spiderverse and strings it along a relatively matured heroes journey coming to it's end tale that is closer to Logan than any other animation I can think off. Oh and just in case (not that I personally care much about it) there is zero political agenda to be found here to be a distraction of the perception."

            ","I was not at all interested in watching this film. As most of the animated movies from the major studios, especially from DreamWorks have been extremely dull and very samey. I can't think of a good one that I've seen since How To Train Your Dragon 2.But then I read all of the brilliant reviews and decided to give this one a go. And to my surprise, it was definitely a welcome change.Puss gets an existential crises when Death (AKA the Big Bad Wolf) comes for his last life after Puss has frivolously wasted his 8 other ones. It's interesting how dark it gets in these scenes, with Puss, who has never been afraid of death, gets scared and has a wakeup call. And learns to value life and the lives of others a bit more.Although it doesn't go as far as I thought it would when it came to heavy themes and character development, it certainly reminded me of the good old days of DreamWorks animation. So I absolutely consider this film a step in the right direction for this studio."

But, I think the kids still understood it enjoyed the deeper parts.Personally, the movie was very fitting. Like Puss, I'm also trying to find out who I am and who I want to be in life. This was our journey.The stories have great connections romantically, between rivals and newcomers. The stories are about bringing all of us together despite what happened in the past.

            ","Puss in Boots: The Last Wish provides a fun adventure with meaningful lessons and tons of vibrant action. Donde está la Leche?The first 30 minutes of the movie are filled with your typical Puss as he sings, dances, and fights with his ever-so-charismatic yet cocky personality. He is quickly humbled when he finds out he needs to be more careful with his life, and this is where I was instantly hooked.Then enters the big bad wolf, from the wolf's menacing character design, skin trembling voice to the life-threatening fighting style. Wolf was one of the fantastic antagonists. I questioned whether this would be too much for the younger audience because the wolf's scenes struck fear in our beloved Puss. Although, as a viewer, we know nothing serious will happen, I felt this was a strong enough case for the plot.It didn't end there; we are introduced to various fairytale Characters. I am not going to spoil too much.Overall, the movie is fast-paced, has adult humor, and represents a love story, greed, and the beauty of friendship.Verdict: Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a fun time for the family; I would suggest watching it if you have younger ones. Even if you don't have younger ones and are a fan of the Shrek universe, it's worth the watch. Shoutout to Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek for there wonderful performances!"

            ","Seems that these days all the animated kids movies are more or less the same, with very few exceptions in recent years and it's grown tiresome. It's always potty humor and/or a weak storyline that either has adults rolling their eyes or falling asleep. This is one of the exceptions.With pitch perfect voice acting from all parts of the cast, to the way it makes old story concepts feel relatively fresh and funny again, this one is a winner. Best of all was the film doesn't rely on low brow, toilet humor to sell it's laughs. My favorite of which came from a certain play on Jiminy Cricket that I'm sure will have you in stitches.The animation had me a bit underwhelmed which is why I deduct a star, but that is subjective, so I leave that bit up to the viewer to decide for themselves. For me, when the action gets going, it felt glitchy and incomplete, but some people might enjoy that style.Overall, I highly recommend this one when it releases later this month. It's definitely a film that both kids and parents will find entertaining and enjoyable. I know I enjoyed it.4.5 retired heros out of 5."

We didn't get the usual Shrek style, Grimm fairytale cameos for no reason, on the contrary, they all played an important role in the story, and in the overall message.This movie also had me so emotional, no spoilers, but it's the way the creators handle their characters, with such sincerity and heart.Finally, the action, and the plot itself, it was go go go from the get go, i haven't seen a more well paced film all year, i think that is my favourite part of the dilm (Avatar 2 could take some notes)Overall, it was truly such a blast, so fun, heartfelt, FUNNY, genuine, with a great message at its core."

Why on earth are you giving this one a 10?!?""Because this movie...is DIFFERENT than the others. Different in that it strives to be a funnier, deeper, prettier, bolder, edgier, (surprisingly) scarier and overall more complete experience than the original Puss in Boots film over 11 years ago, and unlike that movie holds a distinct accomplishment in simply being a darn fine animated film that stands on its own, one as good as any I've seen in the past few years.The Shrekiverse is officially back, and judging by what DreamWorks managed to pull off here the world probably isn't ready for whatever comes next. Seriously, this gives the first two films in the franchise alone a run for their money.Looks like The House That Shrek Built is finally back on top again.PS: That cricket with the spot-on Jimmy Stewart voice is one of the funniest things I've seen this year, whoever came up with him deserves a pay raise and a medal and free coffee and recognition from the United Nations."

After all, the film has very strong existential elements....things that would be mostly lost on kids.This film starts with the usual self-assured heroism you would expect in a Puss in Boots cartoon. But then something most unusual happens...after defying death again and again, Puss suddenly realizes his own mortality, as he realizes he's used up eight of his nine lives...and soon he will die once and for all! As a result, he's now afraid to be his old dashing self. So, he goes off in search of some magical wish...in the hopes that he can regain his previous lives. But, not surprisingly, along the way he discovers so much more.The animation is lovely and the story quite enjoyable. There really isn't much to complain about with this story...it's well made and hard not to like.

            ","In an age when movie and TV franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (I'm looking at you, Disney), I don't think anyone was expecting much from Puss In Boots: The Last Wish - certainly not I.After the first 5 minutes, I knew this was something special.Firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from Arkane and Enter The Spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. The 2D elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.The music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).The dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. Not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling I think I've ever seen. In a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. The cast do a great job of selling them too. Goldi and the bears come out with brilliant British-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.And then there's the wolf. This character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. His style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, I'm serious).At a time when Disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - Dreamworks have taken on the mantle.It made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. Partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. You might think I'm overselling it, but Hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.There are those that say that Hollywood is done - I know I do. But Dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

-Very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-Jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-Surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-Is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-Fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.Adorable Characters/Feel
-New characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-Fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-The feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-Has that element of Shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.The Animation
-It's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy DreamWorks does so well.-The design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-The world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that I certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-And it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-Overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than Disney for the blend of real and cartoons.The Voice Acting:
-Many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-Mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that SNL like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. He own the Horner character and brought some of the best lines.-Wagner Moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the Big-Bad Wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-Though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-Pugh is okay, not my favorite role as Goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. Note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-Guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy Is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. It does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-Hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-Banderas takes Boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the Spanish stereotype. And yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.The References/Jokes
-The stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of Shrek.-It's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-The fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-It feels like the first two Shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. Again, refreshing that they were able to step back.The Designs Changes To An Extent
-Creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-Like Into the Spiderverse? Good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that Puss does.-Not overused, which is very good for me.The Action At Times
-Shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-This movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-The ending fight shows the potential of what DreamWorks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes I've seen this year.The Heart
-Lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-The movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-There are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. That's hard to do in many things.-I love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-Have not felt this way since Shrek 2.DISLIKES:The Darkness
-It's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-Caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-Might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.Predictable
-The lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-The movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-Kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.Too Many Antagonists
-One of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-They do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-Need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-Several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.The Comedy Is Still Tapered
-It's starting to go back to Shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-Still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-Where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made Shrek, Shrek.-They took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.The Animation Changes At Times
-The animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-The comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the Spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-Just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.The Action Still Not Complete
--Shrek and Shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-This movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-The stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-They sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-Often was shorter than I wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. Chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.The VERDICT
I must say, Puss In Boots: The Last Wish was a much better film than when I walked in. Perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the Shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. Animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. It evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. And it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. This film is indeed a solid return to the world and I had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. However, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. Balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance I was looking for. The movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with Puss In Boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. And the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the Shrek that we saw in the first two movies. Still, I do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

            ","I did not expect the sequel to a decent spin-off Dreamworks film from over a decade ago to be one of the most poignant, introspective, genuinely hilarious, and heartwarming films of the year. But here we are.After an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, The Last Wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. The film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.The screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. And it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.What I also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.I adored this film. I think it's Dreamworks' best film since Megamind and it's easily the best true family film of the year."

            ","""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is as spry and light on its feet as its titular feline. The inherently alluring paradox of the swashbuckling kitty from the ""Shrek"" universe remains firmly in place 11 years after his first solo feature. He's a dashing adventurer, a charmer with the ladies, feared and renowned throughout the land -- but he's also unbearably adorable as he laps up milk from a shot glass with his pinky, sandpapery tongue. As always, the charismatic and sensitive Antonio Banderas finds just the right tone in exploring this furry animated figure's suave and silly sides. ""The Last Wish"" expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the Oscar-nominated 2011 original ""Puss in Boots."" Joining Banderas and his longtime friend and co-star Salma Hayek Pinault are Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and John Mulaney, among many others. They bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor. But of course, the fast-paced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director Joel Crawford and co-director Januel Mercado's film. The film's aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences, especially during the action sequences, but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight. From the moss growing on a fearsome forest giant to the shiny silkiness of Puss' whiskers blowing in the wind, ""The Last Wish"" offers a variety of eye-popping details. And it frequently features dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves to transition from past to present or one scene to the next. But the film also manages to convey messages of selflessness and teamwork in a way that doesn't feel heavy-handed or cloying. And the stellar voice performances and dazzling visuals keep things so engaging you won't need a laser pointer or a catnip-stuffed mouse toy to entertain you."

            ","CS Lewis once said a children's story that only appeals to children is not a good children's film in the least. I can think of plenty of crummy kids' movies that illustrate the point, but I'd rather bring up a positive example-- PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH.I cannot believe I am saying this about a Shrek spinoff, but this movie really is that good. It works on so many levels: as a high-speed comedy, all the jokes land, but as a story about mortality and the meaning of life, this film is oddly compelling and mature. The plot literally involves Puss running from the personification of death, hoping to cling to his life. In between the funny scenes, I was actually moved by the existential crisis of this cartoon cat. That's no small feat.This is truly a movie kids and adults can cherish."

The animation is brilliant, characters are charming, pacing is tight, very funny and the action is excellent. Not to mention there is a ton of heart. If I were to nitpick I think one of the antagonists trumps the other. One is played for more comedic purposes while the other is an Intimidating physical presence for boots to contend with. The Last Wish has something for everyone and it's probably one of the better animated movies I've seen in sometime. I really don't want to get into the story to avoid spoilers because the movie was a lot of fun, and it's best to go into it fresh. If anyone is considering taking their family to see the Last Wish like I did then The Last Wish is an easy recommendation. 100% worth the money. Two thumbs up for team friendship."

            ","The last ""Puss In Boots"" movie was made 11 years ago, as well as the last film the ""Shrek"" franchise, so surely they couldn't make something really great again, right? The story is pretty standard, as Puss In Boots is down to his last life and tries to get a wish on a magic star. It seriously has some of the best action I've seen in a long time. I don't even think this film qualifies as a comedy. It really is more like a straightforward action flick. Even its first five minutes are nothing but nonstop action from Frame 1 to Frame...whatever.This film does not take place before the Shrek films. We get to see some brief flashbacks with Shrek himself, albeit only for a few seconds. The villains are Big Jack Horner, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and a wolf. I believe a poster called this character the Big Bad Wolf, but he isn't that, even if he's technically based on him (he's actually DEATH). Every one of these villains are unique with their own motivations. Every minute makes me eager to find out what happens next.So...who does get the wish in the end? Nobody! Everyone (except Big Jack Horner) realizes they had what they wanted after awhile. It even begins with another sequel hook with Puss In Boots going back to Far Far Away Land. Another Shrek/Puss In Boots movie? If it has such amazing cel shading animation with the best CGI of all, it deserves as many films as possible! ****"

            ","Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) becomes a popular folk hero in his country. After his latest conquest of a giant monster, he was killed by a freak accident with a church bell. When he woke up, Puss realized that he already spent eight of his nine lives, and that he only had one more life to live. At first he did not think it was a big deal, but a traumatic encounter with a sinister-looking Wolf (Wagner Moura) made Puss decide to retire from adventures.While living the life of a spoiled lazy lap cat, Puss learned about a Wishing Star from the family of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo) who were looking for it. Puss decided to search for the Star himself in order to wish for his nine lives back. Along with Puss on his quest were his old flame Kitty Softpaws (Selma Hayek) and a nameless little orphan therapy dog (Harvey Guillen).This sequel to the first ""Puss in Boots"" solo spin-off movie came out 11 years after the original. There is a very evident difference that can be noted in the style of its animation. On top of the 3D computer-generated images of the characters, there is now an additional 2D artistic style as if they were hand-painted (first seen in ""The Bad Guys""), especially noted most prominently in the character of the Wolf, and even in Puss during their showdown fight scenes.The voice work of the actors really captured the personalities of the characters. Antonio Banderas's voice had the bravado, arrogance and charisma of Puss, whom we've known and loved since he made his first appearance in ""Shrek 2"" (2004). Selma Hayek lends her sexy sassiness to the voice of the skillful thief Kitty Softpaws, who held a grudge against Puss. Florence Pugh's characteristic raspiness was easily recognizable in Goldilocks's voice.Like before, the characters Puss encounters were all fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters. The choice for main antagonist was Jack Horner, the boy who sat in the corner eating his pies, but he was not little here anymore. He was not as famous as others, so some kids may need a review of his rhyme to refamiliarize. There were a trove of Disney character references you'll have fun identifying, from Mary Poppins, Alice in Wonderland and Jiminy Cricket.Very notable in this latest Dreamworks release is the darkness of the plot, which was also reflected in the artwork styles and situations depicted. Only in trickles, but this must be the first time blood was seen in a Dreamworks animated film. The language and humor used was also more mature, even with some assumed expletives bleeped out. As the topic of death played a major part in the story, scenes with the Wolf can be very scary for little kids. 8/10.PS: The new DreamWorks Animation opening logo precedes this film. It was quite nostalgic to see the DreamWorks boy seeing famous DreamWorks characters old an new -- like Toothless, Po, Boss Baby, a Troll, the Bad Guys and of course, Shrek with Fiona and Donkey -- as his crescent moon flew him around in space before settling in its place."

            ","This is genuinely one of my favorite films of the year. I hope it gets real recognition and people don't dismiss it as ""just an animated film"".I've always liked DreamWorks films, with my favorite being How to Train Your Dragon 2, but after rewatching the first Puss in Boots movie, I wasn't expecting much for this sequel, eleven years after. I like the first installment for sure but it's certainly a lot simpler in story than I'd prefer. This one however, has such a rich emotional aspect to it that I truly felt something during it.There were also certain scenes involving a wolf character that were quite creepy. I think kids will have a lot of fun with this movie, but at the core this is a story about family and understanding the value of things and/or people who are in front of you already. And that's a message that every person of any age can get something out of. The voice acting is top-notch and the animation is such a ridiculous step-up from the last time. This is such a cool direction to take this sequel into and I dug it all the way through.There's really not much negative to say other than the ending feels like it should have been slightly more concise, but that's it.

            ","I did not have many expectations going into this with my daughter, I've seen the main Shrek movies but noon of the other Puss in Boot's spin-offs. I was shocked at how good a movie this was when the credits rolled!The story itself is functional, but all characters are given meaningful and relatable arcs. Between the melanchonic Puss reaching the end of his days as a great hero, his always positive dog sidekick and the 3 antagonistic parties trying to reach the magical macguffin there is a lot going on and none of it feels forced in.The two greatest assets the movie brings is it's humor and the stunning action scenes. First of all, this movie has bite, it is back to the tone of the first Shrek movie with lots of jokes that are working on a children and adult level of understanding. While the story is easy to follow for kids, the themes explored are relatively mature and will keep adults engaged.Secondly, while Disney/Pixar movies lately fail to make action exiting with their polished CGI style, Puss in boots goes full Into the Spiderverse once a fight breaks out. Glorious 12 frames per second, hyper stylized with all the filters and gimmicks necessary to elevate the big set-pieces to something truly special and memorable. Especially Puss's duels against a mysterious bounty hunter are the highlights.While not entirely original, the Puss in Boots: The Last Wish combines the edgy humor of Shrek with the visual wonders of Into the Spiderverse and strings it along a relatively matured heroes journey coming to it's end tale that is closer to Logan than any other animation I can think off. Oh and just in case (not that I personally care much about it) there is zero political agenda to be found here to be a distraction of the perception."

I can't think of a good one that I've seen since How To Train Your Dragon 2.But then I read all of the brilliant reviews and decided to give this one a go. And to my surprise, it was definitely a welcome change.Puss gets an existential crises when Death (AKA the Big Bad Wolf) comes for his last life after Puss has frivolously wasted his 8 other ones. It's interesting how dark it gets in these scenes, with Puss, who has never been afraid of death, gets scared and has a wakeup call. And learns to value life and the lives of others a bit more.Although it doesn't go as far as I thought it would when it came to heavy themes and character development, it certainly reminded me of the good old days of DreamWorks animation.

He is quickly humbled when he finds out he needs to be more careful with his life, and this is where I was instantly hooked.Then enters the big bad wolf, from the wolf's menacing character design, skin trembling voice to the life-threatening fighting style. Wolf was one of the fantastic antagonists. I questioned whether this would be too much for the younger audience because the wolf's scenes struck fear in our beloved Puss. Although, as a viewer, we know nothing serious will happen, I felt this was a strong enough case for the plot.It didn't end there; we are introduced to various fairytale Characters. I am not going to spoil too much.Overall, the movie is fast-paced, has adult humor, and represents a love story, greed, and the beauty of friendship.Verdict: Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a fun time for the family; I would suggest watching it if you have younger ones.

            ","In an age when movie and TV franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (I'm looking at you, Disney), I don't think anyone was expecting much from Puss In Boots: The Last Wish - certainly not I.After the first 5 minutes, I knew this was something special.Firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from Arkane and Enter The Spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. The 2D elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.The music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).The dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. Not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling I think I've ever seen. In a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. The cast do a great job of selling them too. Goldi and the bears come out with brilliant British-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.And then there's the wolf. This character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. His style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, I'm serious).At a time when Disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - Dreamworks have taken on the mantle.It made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. Partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. You might think I'm overselling it, but Hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.There are those that say that Hollywood is done - I know I do. But Dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

My wife and I just got back from the theater, and absolutely LOVED this movie, even more than any of the Shrek movies and the first Puss in Boots!This movie has SO MUCH to love, from BEAUTIFUL visuals/action to consistent humor that actually had us laughing to engaging characters, both old and new. Such a fun time, and so worth seeing in the theaters, though we'll definitely be picking up a copy once it's out on DVD!Without giving too much away, there are several different antagonists in this movie that scratch all the bad-guy itches, covering the spectrum from totally hateable to horrifying to relatable and sympathetic. A great cast! Also, the magical world they came up with for this movie was awesome, with some really cool/unique features!At first, we were a little worried about the dog character, neither of us being big fans of daffy sidekicks, but we were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves rooting for him! He's hilarious, and that's coming from a cat-lover!Several callbacks to the first Puss in Boots movie made this one feel less like a spin-off than a worthy standalone franchise, and the movie was PACKED with magical references that all ages will be able to recognize and enjoy.Do yourself a favor and free a few hours for this one!! A rare 10 from me!!"

            ","It is beyond crazy how good this movie was. The character development was so very well-done, Puss experiencing fear for the first time, and his fear of mortality was so palpable, well, reasoned and relatable.Death's characterizations was on point, his motivation made complete sense, and he was really horrifying, I totally understood why Puss was so afraid of him.The side characters were all likeable. The dog was a delight, and the bear family's arc was genuinely touching with several emotional moments.They also landed the ending, and the final shot not only gave me major Pirates Of The Carribbean vibes, it also gave me so much hope for what's to come. I would be happy if they made another installment."

            ","LIKES:Pacing
-Very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-Jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-Surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-Is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-Fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.Adorable Characters/Feel
-New characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-Fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-The feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-Has that element of Shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.The Animation
-It's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy DreamWorks does so well.-The design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-The world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that I certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-And it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-Overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than Disney for the blend of real and cartoons.The Voice Acting:
-Many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-Mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that SNL like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. He own the Horner character and brought some of the best lines.-Wagner Moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the Big-Bad Wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-Though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-Pugh is okay, not my favorite role as Goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. Note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-Guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy Is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. It does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-Hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-Banderas takes Boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the Spanish stereotype. And yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.The References/Jokes
-The stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of Shrek.-It's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-The fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-It feels like the first two Shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. Again, refreshing that they were able to step back.The Designs Changes To An Extent
-Creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-Like Into the Spiderverse? Good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that Puss does.-Not overused, which is very good for me.The Action At Times
-Shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-This movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-The ending fight shows the potential of what DreamWorks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes I've seen this year.The Heart
-Lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-The movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-There are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. That's hard to do in many things.-I love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-Have not felt this way since Shrek 2.DISLIKES:The Darkness
-It's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-Caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-Might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.Predictable
-The lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-The movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-Kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.Too Many Antagonists
-One of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-They do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-Need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-Several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.The Comedy Is Still Tapered
-It's starting to go back to Shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-Still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-Where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made Shrek, Shrek.-They took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.The Animation Changes At Times
-The animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-The comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the Spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-Just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.The Action Still Not Complete
--Shrek and Shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-This movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-The stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-They sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-Often was shorter than I wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. Chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.The VERDICT
I must say, Puss In Boots: The Last Wish was a much better film than when I walked in. Perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the Shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. Animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. It evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. And it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. This film is indeed a solid return to the world and I had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. However, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. Balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance I was looking for. The movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with Puss In Boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. And the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the Shrek that we saw in the first two movies. Still, I do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

            ","I did not expect the sequel to a decent spin-off Dreamworks film from over a decade ago to be one of the most poignant, introspective, genuinely hilarious, and heartwarming films of the year. But here we are.After an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, The Last Wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. The film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.The screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. And it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.What I also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.I adored this film. I think it's Dreamworks' best film since Megamind and it's easily the best true family film of the year."

            ","""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is as spry and light on its feet as its titular feline. The inherently alluring paradox of the swashbuckling kitty from the ""Shrek"" universe remains firmly in place 11 years after his first solo feature. He's a dashing adventurer, a charmer with the ladies, feared and renowned throughout the land -- but he's also unbearably adorable as he laps up milk from a shot glass with his pinky, sandpapery tongue. As always, the charismatic and sensitive Antonio Banderas finds just the right tone in exploring this furry animated figure's suave and silly sides. ""The Last Wish"" expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the Oscar-nominated 2011 original ""Puss in Boots."" Joining Banderas and his longtime friend and co-star Salma Hayek Pinault are Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and John Mulaney, among many others. They bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor. But of course, the fast-paced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director Joel Crawford and co-director Januel Mercado's film. The film's aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences, especially during the action sequences, but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight. From the moss growing on a fearsome forest giant to the shiny silkiness of Puss' whiskers blowing in the wind, ""The Last Wish"" offers a variety of eye-popping details. And it frequently features dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves to transition from past to present or one scene to the next. But the film also manages to convey messages of selflessness and teamwork in a way that doesn't feel heavy-handed or cloying. And the stellar voice performances and dazzling visuals keep things so engaging you won't need a laser pointer or a catnip-stuffed mouse toy to entertain you."

            ","CS Lewis once said a children's story that only appeals to children is not a good children's film in the least. I can think of plenty of crummy kids' movies that illustrate the point, but I'd rather bring up a positive example-- PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH.I cannot believe I am saying this about a Shrek spinoff, but this movie really is that good. It works on so many levels: as a high-speed comedy, all the jokes land, but as a story about mortality and the meaning of life, this film is oddly compelling and mature. The plot literally involves Puss running from the personification of death, hoping to cling to his life. In between the funny scenes, I was actually moved by the existential crisis of this cartoon cat. That's no small feat.This is truly a movie kids and adults can cherish."

I love how it blended the typical CGI look with the new, more hand-drawn style. That combined with some top notch humor and an incredibly emotional story makes this a terrific watch.

            ","Puss and Boots the last wish is a fantastic sequel and inarguably better than the charming first outing. The animation is brilliant, characters are charming, pacing is tight, very funny and the action is excellent. Not to mention there is a ton of heart. If I were to nitpick I think one of the antagonists trumps the other. One is played for more comedic purposes while the other is an Intimidating physical presence for boots to contend with. The Last Wish has something for everyone and it's probably one of the better animated movies I've seen in sometime. I really don't want to get into the story to avoid spoilers because the movie was a lot of fun, and it's best to go into it fresh. If anyone is considering taking their family to see the Last Wish like I did then The Last Wish is an easy recommendation. 100% worth the money. Two thumbs up for team friendship."

            ","The last ""Puss In Boots"" movie was made 11 years ago, as well as the last film the ""Shrek"" franchise, so surely they couldn't make something really great again, right? The story is pretty standard, as Puss In Boots is down to his last life and tries to get a wish on a magic star. It seriously has some of the best action I've seen in a long time. I don't even think this film qualifies as a comedy. It really is more like a straightforward action flick. Even its first five minutes are nothing but nonstop action from Frame 1 to Frame...whatever.This film does not take place before the Shrek films. We get to see some brief flashbacks with Shrek himself, albeit only for a few seconds. The villains are Big Jack Horner, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and a wolf. I believe a poster called this character the Big Bad Wolf, but he isn't that, even if he's technically based on him (he's actually DEATH). Every one of these villains are unique with their own motivations. Every minute makes me eager to find out what happens next.So...who does get the wish in the end? Nobody! Everyone (except Big Jack Horner) realizes they had what they wanted after awhile. It even begins with another sequel hook with Puss In Boots going back to Far Far Away Land. Another Shrek/Puss In Boots movie? If it has such amazing cel shading animation with the best CGI of all, it deserves as many films as possible! ****"

            ","Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) becomes a popular folk hero in his country. After his latest conquest of a giant monster, he was killed by a freak accident with a church bell. When he woke up, Puss realized that he already spent eight of his nine lives, and that he only had one more life to live. At first he did not think it was a big deal, but a traumatic encounter with a sinister-looking Wolf (Wagner Moura) made Puss decide to retire from adventures.While living the life of a spoiled lazy lap cat, Puss learned about a Wishing Star from the family of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo) who were looking for it. Puss decided to search for the Star himself in order to wish for his nine lives back. Along with Puss on his quest were his old flame Kitty Softpaws (Selma Hayek) and a nameless little orphan therapy dog (Harvey Guillen).This sequel to the first ""Puss in Boots"" solo spin-off movie came out 11 years after the original. There is a very evident difference that can be noted in the style of its animation. On top of the 3D computer-generated images of the characters, there is now an additional 2D artistic style as if they were hand-painted (first seen in ""The Bad Guys""), especially noted most prominently in the character of the Wolf, and even in Puss during their showdown fight scenes.The voice work of the actors really captured the personalities of the characters. Antonio Banderas's voice had the bravado, arrogance and charisma of Puss, whom we've known and loved since he made his first appearance in ""Shrek 2"" (2004). Selma Hayek lends her sexy sassiness to the voice of the skillful thief Kitty Softpaws, who held a grudge against Puss. Florence Pugh's characteristic raspiness was easily recognizable in Goldilocks's voice.Like before, the characters Puss encounters were all fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters. The choice for main antagonist was Jack Horner, the boy who sat in the corner eating his pies, but he was not little here anymore. He was not as famous as others, so some kids may need a review of his rhyme to refamiliarize. There were a trove of Disney character references you'll have fun identifying, from Mary Poppins, Alice in Wonderland and Jiminy Cricket.Very notable in this latest Dreamworks release is the darkness of the plot, which was also reflected in the artwork styles and situations depicted. Only in trickles, but this must be the first time blood was seen in a Dreamworks animated film. The language and humor used was also more mature, even with some assumed expletives bleeped out. As the topic of death played a major part in the story, scenes with the Wolf can be very scary for little kids. 8/10.PS: The new DreamWorks Animation opening logo precedes this film. It was quite nostalgic to see the DreamWorks boy seeing famous DreamWorks characters old an new -- like Toothless, Po, Boss Baby, a Troll, the Bad Guys and of course, Shrek with Fiona and Donkey -- as his crescent moon flew him around in space before settling in its place."

I hope it gets real recognition and people don't dismiss it as ""just an animated film"".I've always liked DreamWorks films, with my favorite being How to Train Your Dragon 2, but after rewatching the first Puss in Boots movie, I wasn't expecting much for this sequel, eleven years after. I like the first installment for sure but it's certainly a lot simpler in story than I'd prefer. This one however, has such a rich emotional aspect to it that I truly felt something during it.There were also certain scenes involving a wolf character that were quite creepy. I think kids will have a lot of fun with this movie, but at the core this is a story about family and understanding the value of things and/or people who are in front of you already. And that's a message that every person of any age can get something out of. The voice acting is top-notch and the animation is such a ridiculous step-up from the last time. This is such a cool direction to take this sequel into and I dug it all the way through.There's really not much negative to say other than the ending feels like it should have been slightly more concise, but that's it.

            ","I did not have many expectations going into this with my daughter, I've seen the main Shrek movies but noon of the other Puss in Boot's spin-offs. I was shocked at how good a movie this was when the credits rolled!The story itself is functional, but all characters are given meaningful and relatable arcs. Between the melanchonic Puss reaching the end of his days as a great hero, his always positive dog sidekick and the 3 antagonistic parties trying to reach the magical macguffin there is a lot going on and none of it feels forced in.The two greatest assets the movie brings is it's humor and the stunning action scenes. First of all, this movie has bite, it is back to the tone of the first Shrek movie with lots of jokes that are working on a children and adult level of understanding. While the story is easy to follow for kids, the themes explored are relatively mature and will keep adults engaged.Secondly, while Disney/Pixar movies lately fail to make action exiting with their polished CGI style, Puss in boots goes full Into the Spiderverse once a fight breaks out. Glorious 12 frames per second, hyper stylized with all the filters and gimmicks necessary to elevate the big set-pieces to something truly special and memorable. Especially Puss's duels against a mysterious bounty hunter are the highlights.While not entirely original, the Puss in Boots: The Last Wish combines the edgy humor of Shrek with the visual wonders of Into the Spiderverse and strings it along a relatively matured heroes journey coming to it's end tale that is closer to Logan than any other animation I can think off. Oh and just in case (not that I personally care much about it) there is zero political agenda to be found here to be a distraction of the perception."

I can't think of a good one that I've seen since How To Train Your Dragon 2.But then I read all of the brilliant reviews and decided to give this one a go. And to my surprise, it was definitely a welcome change.Puss gets an existential crises when Death (AKA the Big Bad Wolf) comes for his last life after Puss has frivolously wasted his 8 other ones. It's interesting how dark it gets in these scenes, with Puss, who has never been afraid of death, gets scared and has a wakeup call. And learns to value life and the lives of others a bit more.Although it doesn't go as far as I thought it would when it came to heavy themes and character development, it certainly reminded me of the good old days of DreamWorks animation.

He is quickly humbled when he finds out he needs to be more careful with his life, and this is where I was instantly hooked.Then enters the big bad wolf, from the wolf's menacing character design, skin trembling voice to the life-threatening fighting style. Wolf was one of the fantastic antagonists. I questioned whether this would be too much for the younger audience because the wolf's scenes struck fear in our beloved Puss. Although, as a viewer, we know nothing serious will happen, I felt this was a strong enough case for the plot.It didn't end there; we are introduced to various fairytale Characters. I am not going to spoil too much.Overall, the movie is fast-paced, has adult humor, and represents a love story, greed, and the beauty of friendship.Verdict: Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a fun time for the family; I would suggest watching it if you have younger ones. Even if you don't have younger ones and are a fan of the Shrek universe, it's worth the watch. Shoutout to Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek for there wonderful performances!"

Different in that it strives to be a funnier, deeper, prettier, bolder, edgier, (surprisingly) scarier and overall more complete experience than the original Puss in Boots film over 11 years ago, and unlike that movie holds a distinct accomplishment in simply being a darn fine animated film that stands on its own, one as good as any I've seen in the past few years.The Shrekiverse is officially back, and judging by what DreamWorks managed to pull off here the world probably isn't ready for whatever comes next. Seriously, this gives the first two films in the franchise alone a run for their money.Looks like The House That Shrek Built is finally back on top again.PS: That cricket with the spot-on Jimmy Stewart voice is one of the funniest things I've seen this year, whoever came up with him deserves a pay raise and a medal and free coffee and recognition from the United Nations."

            ","Puss In Boots: The Last WishIt's not every time that a franchise can progressively get better, but this new instalment in the Shrek universe proves just that. Aided by stunning visuals, Puss In Boots: The Last Wish takes audiences on a thrilling, heartfelt and contemplative journey. It also blends its dark elements perfectly with its comedy.The plot is poignant. The characters are very distinct, and each one is developed properly. Having antagonists that range from sympathetic to horrifying also helps keep things fun. The voice work of the cast should also be praised. The action sequences are well-choreographed and smooth.One of the best animations from DreamWorks.9-9.5/10."

            ","""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is a most unusual CGI film from Dreamworks. This is because although kids might like it, it's clearly intended for adults. After all, the film has very strong existential elements....things that would be mostly lost on kids.This film starts with the usual self-assured heroism you would expect in a Puss in Boots cartoon. But then something most unusual happens...after defying death again and again, Puss suddenly realizes his own mortality, as he realizes he's used up eight of his nine lives...and soon he will die once and for all! As a result, he's now afraid to be his old dashing self. So, he goes off in search of some magical wish...in the hopes that he can regain his previous lives. But, not surprisingly, along the way he discovers so much more.The animation is lovely and the story quite enjoyable. There really isn't much to complain about with this story...it's well made and hard not to like. It also is amazingly deep and unusual...not the usual vacuous sequel just made to capitalize on the original film's success."

            ","In an age when movie and TV franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (I'm looking at you, Disney), I don't think anyone was expecting much from Puss In Boots: The Last Wish - certainly not I.After the first 5 minutes, I knew this was something special.Firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from Arkane and Enter The Spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. The 2D elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.The music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).The dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. Not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling I think I've ever seen. In a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. The cast do a great job of selling them too. Goldi and the bears come out with brilliant British-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.And then there's the wolf. This character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. His style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, I'm serious).At a time when Disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - Dreamworks have taken on the mantle.It made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. Partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. You might think I'm overselling it, but Hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.There are those that say that Hollywood is done - I know I do. But Dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

            ","You heard me!

Such a fun time, and so worth seeing in the theaters, though we'll definitely be picking up a copy once it's out on DVD!Without giving too much away, there are several different antagonists in this movie that scratch all the bad-guy itches, covering the spectrum from totally hateable to horrifying to relatable and sympathetic. A great cast! Also, the magical world they came up with for this movie was awesome, with some really cool/unique features!At first, we were a little worried about the dog character, neither of us being big fans of daffy sidekicks, but we were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves rooting for him! He's hilarious, and that's coming from a cat-lover!Several callbacks to the first Puss in Boots movie made this one feel less like a spin-off than a worthy standalone franchise, and the movie was PACKED with magical references that all ages will be able to recognize and enjoy.Do yourself a favor and free a few hours for this one!!

            ","LIKES:Pacing
-Very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-Jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-Surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-Is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-Fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.Adorable Characters/Feel
-New characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-Fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-The feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-Has that element of Shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.The Animation
-It's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy DreamWorks does so well.-The design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-The world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that I certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-And it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-Overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than Disney for the blend of real and cartoons.The Voice Acting:
-Many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-Mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that SNL like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. He own the Horner character and brought some of the best lines.-Wagner Moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the Big-Bad Wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-Though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-Pugh is okay, not my favorite role as Goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. Note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-Guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy Is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. It does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-Hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-Banderas takes Boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the Spanish stereotype. And yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.The References/Jokes
-The stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of Shrek.-It's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-The fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-It feels like the first two Shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. Again, refreshing that they were able to step back.The Designs Changes To An Extent
-Creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-Like Into the Spiderverse? Good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that Puss does.-Not overused, which is very good for me.The Action At Times
-Shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-This movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-The ending fight shows the potential of what DreamWorks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes I've seen this year.The Heart
-Lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-The movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-There are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. That's hard to do in many things.-I love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-Have not felt this way since Shrek 2.DISLIKES:The Darkness
-It's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-Caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-Might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.Predictable
-The lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-The movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-Kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.Too Many Antagonists
-One of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-They do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-Need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-Several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.The Comedy Is Still Tapered
-It's starting to go back to Shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-Still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-Where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made Shrek, Shrek.-They took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.The Animation Changes At Times
-The animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-The comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the Spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-Just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.The Action Still Not Complete
--Shrek and Shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-This movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-The stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-They sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-Often was shorter than I wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. Chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.The VERDICT
I must say, Puss In Boots: The Last Wish was a much better film than when I walked in. Perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the Shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. Animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. It evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. And it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. This film is indeed a solid return to the world and I had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. However, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. Balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance I was looking for. The movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with Puss In Boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. And the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the Shrek that we saw in the first two movies. Still, I do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

            ","I did not expect the sequel to a decent spin-off Dreamworks film from over a decade ago to be one of the most poignant, introspective, genuinely hilarious, and heartwarming films of the year. But here we are.After an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, The Last Wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. The film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.The screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. And it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.What I also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.I adored this film. I think it's Dreamworks' best film since Megamind and it's easily the best true family film of the year."

            ","""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is as spry and light on its feet as its titular feline. The inherently alluring paradox of the swashbuckling kitty from the ""Shrek"" universe remains firmly in place 11 years after his first solo feature. He's a dashing adventurer, a charmer with the ladies, feared and renowned throughout the land -- but he's also unbearably adorable as he laps up milk from a shot glass with his pinky, sandpapery tongue. As always, the charismatic and sensitive Antonio Banderas finds just the right tone in exploring this furry animated figure's suave and silly sides. ""The Last Wish"" expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the Oscar-nominated 2011 original ""Puss in Boots."" Joining Banderas and his longtime friend and co-star Salma Hayek Pinault are Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and John Mulaney, among many others. They bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor. But of course, the fast-paced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director Joel Crawford and co-director Januel Mercado's film. The film's aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences, especially during the action sequences, but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight. From the moss growing on a fearsome forest giant to the shiny silkiness of Puss' whiskers blowing in the wind, ""The Last Wish"" offers a variety of eye-popping details. And it frequently features dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves to transition from past to present or one scene to the next. But the film also manages to convey messages of selflessness and teamwork in a way that doesn't feel heavy-handed or cloying. And the stellar voice performances and dazzling visuals keep things so engaging you won't need a laser pointer or a catnip-stuffed mouse toy to entertain you."

I can think of plenty of crummy kids' movies that illustrate the point, but I'd rather bring up a positive example-- PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH.I cannot believe I am saying this about a Shrek spinoff, but this movie really is that good. It works on so many levels: as a high-speed comedy, all the jokes land, but as a story about mortality and the meaning of life, this film is oddly compelling and mature. The plot literally involves Puss running from the personification of death, hoping to cling to his life. In between the funny scenes, I was actually moved by the existential crisis of this cartoon cat. That's no small feat.This is truly a movie kids and adults can cherish."

The Last Wish has something for everyone and it's probably one of the better animated movies I've seen in sometime. I really don't want to get into the story to avoid spoilers because the movie was a lot of fun, and it's best to go into it fresh.

            ","The last ""Puss In Boots"" movie was made 11 years ago, as well as the last film the ""Shrek"" franchise, so surely they couldn't make something really great again, right? The story is pretty standard, as Puss In Boots is down to his last life and tries to get a wish on a magic star. It seriously has some of the best action I've seen in a long time. I don't even think this film qualifies as a comedy. It really is more like a straightforward action flick. Even its first five minutes are nothing but nonstop action from Frame 1 to Frame...whatever.This film does not take place before the Shrek films. We get to see some brief flashbacks with Shrek himself, albeit only for a few seconds. The villains are Big Jack Horner, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and a wolf. I believe a poster called this character the Big Bad Wolf, but he isn't that, even if he's technically based on him (he's actually DEATH). Every one of these villains are unique with their own motivations. Every minute makes me eager to find out what happens next.So...who does get the wish in the end? Nobody! Everyone (except Big Jack Horner) realizes they had what they wanted after awhile. It even begins with another sequel hook with Puss In Boots going back to Far Far Away Land.

            ","Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) becomes a popular folk hero in his country. After his latest conquest of a giant monster, he was killed by a freak accident with a church bell. When he woke up, Puss realized that he already spent eight of his nine lives, and that he only had one more life to live. At first he did not think it was a big deal, but a traumatic encounter with a sinister-looking Wolf (Wagner Moura) made Puss decide to retire from adventures.While living the life of a spoiled lazy lap cat, Puss learned about a Wishing Star from the family of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo) who were looking for it. Puss decided to search for the Star himself in order to wish for his nine lives back. Along with Puss on his quest were his old flame Kitty Softpaws (Selma Hayek) and a nameless little orphan therapy dog (Harvey Guillen).This sequel to the first ""Puss in Boots"" solo spin-off movie came out 11 years after the original. There is a very evident difference that can be noted in the style of its animation. On top of the 3D computer-generated images of the characters, there is now an additional 2D artistic style as if they were hand-painted (first seen in ""The Bad Guys""), especially noted most prominently in the character of the Wolf, and even in Puss during their showdown fight scenes.The voice work of the actors really captured the personalities of the characters. Antonio Banderas's voice had the bravado, arrogance and charisma of Puss, whom we've known and loved since he made his first appearance in ""Shrek 2"" (2004). Selma Hayek lends her sexy sassiness to the voice of the skillful thief Kitty Softpaws, who held a grudge against Puss. Florence Pugh's characteristic raspiness was easily recognizable in Goldilocks's voice.Like before, the characters Puss encounters were all fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters. The choice for main antagonist was Jack Horner, the boy who sat in the corner eating his pies, but he was not little here anymore. He was not as famous as others, so some kids may need a review of his rhyme to refamiliarize. There were a trove of Disney character references you'll have fun identifying, from Mary Poppins, Alice in Wonderland and Jiminy Cricket.Very notable in this latest Dreamworks release is the darkness of the plot, which was also reflected in the artwork styles and situations depicted. Only in trickles, but this must be the first time blood was seen in a Dreamworks animated film. The language and humor used was also more mature, even with some assumed expletives bleeped out. As the topic of death played a major part in the story, scenes with the Wolf can be very scary for little kids. 8/10.PS: The new DreamWorks Animation opening logo precedes this film. It was quite nostalgic to see the DreamWorks boy seeing famous DreamWorks characters old an new -- like Toothless, Po, Boss Baby, a Troll, the Bad Guys and of course, Shrek with Fiona and Donkey -- as his crescent moon flew him around in space before settling in its place."

I hope it gets real recognition and people don't dismiss it as ""just an animated film"".I've always liked DreamWorks films, with my favorite being How to Train Your Dragon 2, but after rewatching the first Puss in Boots movie, I wasn't expecting much for this sequel, eleven years after. I like the first installment for sure but it's certainly a lot simpler in story than I'd prefer. This one however, has such a rich emotional aspect to it that I truly felt something during it.There were also certain scenes involving a wolf character that were quite creepy. I think kids will have a lot of fun with this movie, but at the core this is a story about family and understanding the value of things and/or people who are in front of you already. And that's a message that every person of any age can get something out of. The voice acting is top-notch and the animation is such a ridiculous step-up from the last time. This is such a cool direction to take this sequel into and I dug it all the way through.There's really not much negative to say other than the ending feels like it should have been slightly more concise, but that's it.

            ","I did not have many expectations going into this with my daughter, I've seen the main Shrek movies but noon of the other Puss in Boot's spin-offs. I was shocked at how good a movie this was when the credits rolled!The story itself is functional, but all characters are given meaningful and relatable arcs. Between the melanchonic Puss reaching the end of his days as a great hero, his always positive dog sidekick and the 3 antagonistic parties trying to reach the magical macguffin there is a lot going on and none of it feels forced in.The two greatest assets the movie brings is it's humor and the stunning action scenes. First of all, this movie has bite, it is back to the tone of the first Shrek movie with lots of jokes that are working on a children and adult level of understanding. While the story is easy to follow for kids, the themes explored are relatively mature and will keep adults engaged.Secondly, while Disney/Pixar movies lately fail to make action exiting with their polished CGI style, Puss in boots goes full Into the Spiderverse once a fight breaks out. Glorious 12 frames per second, hyper stylized with all the filters and gimmicks necessary to elevate the big set-pieces to something truly special and memorable. Especially Puss's duels against a mysterious bounty hunter are the highlights.While not entirely original, the Puss in Boots: The Last Wish combines the edgy humor of Shrek with the visual wonders of Into the Spiderverse and strings it along a relatively matured heroes journey coming to it's end tale that is closer to Logan than any other animation I can think off. Oh and just in case (not that I personally care much about it) there is zero political agenda to be found here to be a distraction of the perception."

            ","I was not at all interested in watching this film. As most of the animated movies from the major studios, especially from DreamWorks have been extremely dull and very samey. I can't think of a good one that I've seen since How To Train Your Dragon 2.But then I read all of the brilliant reviews and decided to give this one a go. And to my surprise, it was definitely a welcome change.Puss gets an existential crises when Death (AKA the Big Bad Wolf) comes for his last life after Puss has frivolously wasted his 8 other ones. It's interesting how dark it gets in these scenes, with Puss, who has never been afraid of death, gets scared and has a wakeup call. And learns to value life and the lives of others a bit more.Although it doesn't go as far as I thought it would when it came to heavy themes and character development, it certainly reminded me of the good old days of DreamWorks animation. So I absolutely consider this film a step in the right direction for this studio."

But, I think the kids still understood it enjoyed the deeper parts.Personally, the movie was very fitting. Like Puss, I'm also trying to find out who I am and who I want to be in life. This was our journey.The stories have great connections romantically, between rivals and newcomers. The stories are about bringing all of us together despite what happened in the past. The stories come together about building a better future for ALL OF US. Let go of selfish wants and desires, focus on OTHERS and let's work together for a better future!"

            ","Puss in Boots: The Last Wish provides a fun adventure with meaningful lessons and tons of vibrant action. Donde está la Leche?The first 30 minutes of the movie are filled with your typical Puss as he sings, dances, and fights with his ever-so-charismatic yet cocky personality. He is quickly humbled when he finds out he needs to be more careful with his life, and this is where I was instantly hooked.Then enters the big bad wolf, from the wolf's menacing character design, skin trembling voice to the life-threatening fighting style. Wolf was one of the fantastic antagonists. I questioned whether this would be too much for the younger audience because the wolf's scenes struck fear in our beloved Puss. Although, as a viewer, we know nothing serious will happen, I felt this was a strong enough case for the plot.It didn't end there; we are introduced to various fairytale Characters. I am not going to spoil too much.Overall, the movie is fast-paced, has adult humor, and represents a love story, greed, and the beauty of friendship.Verdict: Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a fun time for the family; I would suggest watching it if you have younger ones. Even if you don't have younger ones and are a fan of the Shrek universe, it's worth the watch. Shoutout to Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek for there wonderful performances!"

            ","Seems that these days all the animated kids movies are more or less the same, with very few exceptions in recent years and it's grown tiresome. It's always potty humor and/or a weak storyline that either has adults rolling their eyes or falling asleep. This is one of the exceptions.With pitch perfect voice acting from all parts of the cast, to the way it makes old story concepts feel relatively fresh and funny again, this one is a winner. Best of all was the film doesn't rely on low brow, toilet humor to sell it's laughs. My favorite of which came from a certain play on Jiminy Cricket that I'm sure will have you in stitches.The animation had me a bit underwhelmed which is why I deduct a star, but that is subjective, so I leave that bit up to the viewer to decide for themselves. For me, when the action gets going, it felt glitchy and incomplete, but some people might enjoy that style.Overall, I highly recommend this one when it releases later this month. It's definitely a film that both kids and parents will find entertaining and enjoyable. I know I enjoyed it.4.5 retired heros out of 5."

We didn't get the usual Shrek style, Grimm fairytale cameos for no reason, on the contrary, they all played an important role in the story, and in the overall message.This movie also had me so emotional, no spoilers, but it's the way the creators handle their characters, with such sincerity and heart.Finally, the action, and the plot itself, it was go go go from the get go, i haven't seen a more well paced film all year, i think that is my favourite part of the dilm (Avatar 2 could take some notes)Overall, it was truly such a blast, so fun, heartfelt, FUNNY, genuine, with a great message at its core."

Why on earth are you giving this one a 10?!?""Because this movie...is DIFFERENT than the others. Different in that it strives to be a funnier, deeper, prettier, bolder, edgier, (surprisingly) scarier and overall more complete experience than the original Puss in Boots film over 11 years ago, and unlike that movie holds a distinct accomplishment in simply being a darn fine animated film that stands on its own, one as good as any I've seen in the past few years.The Shrekiverse is officially back, and judging by what DreamWorks managed to pull off here the world probably isn't ready for whatever comes next. Seriously, this gives the first two films in the franchise alone a run for their money.Looks like The House That Shrek Built is finally back on top again.PS: That cricket with the spot-on Jimmy Stewart voice is one of the funniest things I've seen this year, whoever came up with him deserves a pay raise and a medal and free coffee and recognition from the United Nations."

After all, the film has very strong existential elements....things that would be mostly lost on kids.This film starts with the usual self-assured heroism you would expect in a Puss in Boots cartoon. But then something most unusual happens...after defying death again and again, Puss suddenly realizes his own mortality, as he realizes he's used up eight of his nine lives...and soon he will die once and for all! As a result, he's now afraid to be his old dashing self. So, he goes off in search of some magical wish...in the hopes that he can regain his previous lives. But, not surprisingly, along the way he discovers so much more.The animation is lovely and the story quite enjoyable. There really isn't much to complain about with this story...it's well made and hard not to like.

            ","In an age when movie and TV franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (I'm looking at you, Disney), I don't think anyone was expecting much from Puss In Boots: The Last Wish - certainly not I.After the first 5 minutes, I knew this was something special.Firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from Arkane and Enter The Spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. The 2D elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.The music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).The dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. Not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling I think I've ever seen. In a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. The cast do a great job of selling them too. Goldi and the bears come out with brilliant British-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.And then there's the wolf. This character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. His style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, I'm serious).At a time when Disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - Dreamworks have taken on the mantle.It made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. Partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. You might think I'm overselling it, but Hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.There are those that say that Hollywood is done - I know I do. But Dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

-Very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-Jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-Surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-Is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-Fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.Adorable Characters/Feel
-New characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-Fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-The feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-Has that element of Shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.The Animation
-It's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy DreamWorks does so well.-The design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-The world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that I certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-And it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-Overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than Disney for the blend of real and cartoons.The Voice Acting:
-Many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-Mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that SNL like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. He own the Horner character and brought some of the best lines.-Wagner Moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the Big-Bad Wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-Though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-Pugh is okay, not my favorite role as Goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. Note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-Guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy Is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. It does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-Hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-Banderas takes Boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the Spanish stereotype. And yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.The References/Jokes
-The stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of Shrek.-It's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-The fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-It feels like the first two Shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. Again, refreshing that they were able to step back.The Designs Changes To An Extent
-Creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-Like Into the Spiderverse? Good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that Puss does.-Not overused, which is very good for me.The Action At Times
-Shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-This movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-The ending fight shows the potential of what DreamWorks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes I've seen this year.The Heart
-Lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-The movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-There are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. That's hard to do in many things.-I love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-Have not felt this way since Shrek 2.DISLIKES:The Darkness
-It's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-Caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-Might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.Predictable
-The lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-The movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-Kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.Too Many Antagonists
-One of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-They do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-Need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-Several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.The Comedy Is Still Tapered
-It's starting to go back to Shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-Still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-Where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made Shrek, Shrek.-They took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.The Animation Changes At Times
-The animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-The comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the Spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-Just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.The Action Still Not Complete
--Shrek and Shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-This movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-The stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-They sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-Often was shorter than I wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. Chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.The VERDICT
I must say, Puss In Boots: The Last Wish was a much better film than when I walked in. Perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the Shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. Animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. It evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. And it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. This film is indeed a solid return to the world and I had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. However, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. Balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance I was looking for. The movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with Puss In Boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. And the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the Shrek that we saw in the first two movies. Still, I do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

But here we are.After an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, The Last Wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. The film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.The screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. And it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.What I also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.I adored this film.

            ","""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is as spry and light on its feet as its titular feline. The inherently alluring paradox of the swashbuckling kitty from the ""Shrek"" universe remains firmly in place 11 years after his first solo feature. He's a dashing adventurer, a charmer with the ladies, feared and renowned throughout the land -- but he's also unbearably adorable as he laps up milk from a shot glass with his pinky, sandpapery tongue. As always, the charismatic and sensitive Antonio Banderas finds just the right tone in exploring this furry animated figure's suave and silly sides. ""The Last Wish"" expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the Oscar-nominated 2011 original ""Puss in Boots."" Joining Banderas and his longtime friend and co-star Salma Hayek Pinault are Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and John Mulaney, among many others. They bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor. But of course, the fast-paced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director Joel Crawford and co-director Januel Mercado's film. The film's aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences, especially during the action sequences, but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight. From the moss growing on a fearsome forest giant to the shiny silkiness of Puss' whiskers blowing in the wind, ""The Last Wish"" offers a variety of eye-popping details. And it frequently features dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves to transition from past to present or one scene to the next. But the film also manages to convey messages of selflessness and teamwork in a way that doesn't feel heavy-handed or cloying. And the stellar voice performances and dazzling visuals keep things so engaging you won't need a laser pointer or a catnip-stuffed mouse toy to entertain you."

If I were to nitpick I think one of the antagonists trumps the other. One is played for more comedic purposes while the other is an Intimidating physical presence for boots to contend with. The Last Wish has something for everyone and it's probably one of the better animated movies I've seen in sometime. I really don't want to get into the story to avoid spoilers because the movie was a lot of fun, and it's best to go into it fresh. If anyone is considering taking their family to see the Last Wish like I did then The Last Wish is an easy recommendation. 100% worth the money. Two thumbs up for team friendship."

            ","The last ""Puss In Boots"" movie was made 11 years ago, as well as the last film the ""Shrek"" franchise, so surely they couldn't make something really great again, right? The story is pretty standard, as Puss In Boots is down to his last life and tries to get a wish on a magic star. It seriously has some of the best action I've seen in a long time. I don't even think this film qualifies as a comedy. It really is more like a straightforward action flick. Even its first five minutes are nothing but nonstop action from Frame 1 to Frame...whatever.This film does not take place before the Shrek films. We get to see some brief flashbacks with Shrek himself, albeit only for a few seconds. The villains are Big Jack Horner, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and a wolf. I believe a poster called this character the Big Bad Wolf, but he isn't that, even if he's technically based on him (he's actually DEATH). Every one of these villains are unique with their own motivations. Every minute makes me eager to find out what happens next.So...who does get the wish in the end? Nobody! Everyone (except Big Jack Horner) realizes they had what they wanted after awhile. It even begins with another sequel hook with Puss In Boots going back to Far Far Away Land. Another Shrek/Puss In Boots movie? If it has such amazing cel shading animation with the best CGI of all, it deserves as many films as possible! ****"

            ","Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) becomes a popular folk hero in his country. After his latest conquest of a giant monster, he was killed by a freak accident with a church bell. When he woke up, Puss realized that he already spent eight of his nine lives, and that he only had one more life to live. At first he did not think it was a big deal, but a traumatic encounter with a sinister-looking Wolf (Wagner Moura) made Puss decide to retire from adventures.While living the life of a spoiled lazy lap cat, Puss learned about a Wishing Star from the family of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo) who were looking for it. Puss decided to search for the Star himself in order to wish for his nine lives back. Along with Puss on his quest were his old flame Kitty Softpaws (Selma Hayek) and a nameless little orphan therapy dog (Harvey Guillen).This sequel to the first ""Puss in Boots"" solo spin-off movie came out 11 years after the original. There is a very evident difference that can be noted in the style of its animation. On top of the 3D computer-generated images of the characters, there is now an additional 2D artistic style as if they were hand-painted (first seen in ""The Bad Guys""), especially noted most prominently in the character of the Wolf, and even in Puss during their showdown fight scenes.The voice work of the actors really captured the personalities of the characters. Antonio Banderas's voice had the bravado, arrogance and charisma of Puss, whom we've known and loved since he made his first appearance in ""Shrek 2"" (2004). Selma Hayek lends her sexy sassiness to the voice of the skillful thief Kitty Softpaws, who held a grudge against Puss. Florence Pugh's characteristic raspiness was easily recognizable in Goldilocks's voice.Like before, the characters Puss encounters were all fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters. The choice for main antagonist was Jack Horner, the boy who sat in the corner eating his pies, but he was not little here anymore. He was not as famous as others, so some kids may need a review of his rhyme to refamiliarize. There were a trove of Disney character references you'll have fun identifying, from Mary Poppins, Alice in Wonderland and Jiminy Cricket.Very notable in this latest Dreamworks release is the darkness of the plot, which was also reflected in the artwork styles and situations depicted. Only in trickles, but this must be the first time blood was seen in a Dreamworks animated film. The language and humor used was also more mature, even with some assumed expletives bleeped out. As the topic of death played a major part in the story, scenes with the Wolf can be very scary for little kids. 8/10.PS: The new DreamWorks Animation opening logo precedes this film. It was quite nostalgic to see the DreamWorks boy seeing famous DreamWorks characters old an new -- like Toothless, Po, Boss Baby, a Troll, the Bad Guys and of course, Shrek with Fiona and Donkey -- as his crescent moon flew him around in space before settling in its place."

            ","This is genuinely one of my favorite films of the year. I hope it gets real recognition and people don't dismiss it as ""just an animated film"".I've always liked DreamWorks films, with my favorite being How to Train Your Dragon 2, but after rewatching the first Puss in Boots movie, I wasn't expecting much for this sequel, eleven years after. I like the first installment for sure but it's certainly a lot simpler in story than I'd prefer. This one however, has such a rich emotional aspect to it that I truly felt something during it.There were also certain scenes involving a wolf character that were quite creepy. I think kids will have a lot of fun with this movie, but at the core this is a story about family and understanding the value of things and/or people who are in front of you already. And that's a message that every person of any age can get something out of. The voice acting is top-notch and the animation is such a ridiculous step-up from the last time. This is such a cool direction to take this sequel into and I dug it all the way through.There's really not much negative to say other than the ending feels like it should have been slightly more concise, but that's it. I loved it and I'll rewatch it as soon as it releases on VOD."

            ","I did not have many expectations going into this with my daughter, I've seen the main Shrek movies but noon of the other Puss in Boot's spin-offs. I was shocked at how good a movie this was when the credits rolled!The story itself is functional, but all characters are given meaningful and relatable arcs. Between the melanchonic Puss reaching the end of his days as a great hero, his always positive dog sidekick and the 3 antagonistic parties trying to reach the magical macguffin there is a lot going on and none of it feels forced in.The two greatest assets the movie brings is it's humor and the stunning action scenes. First of all, this movie has bite, it is back to the tone of the first Shrek movie with lots of jokes that are working on a children and adult level of understanding. While the story is easy to follow for kids, the themes explored are relatively mature and will keep adults engaged.Secondly, while Disney/Pixar movies lately fail to make action exiting with their polished CGI style, Puss in boots goes full Into the Spiderverse once a fight breaks out. Glorious 12 frames per second, hyper stylized with all the filters and gimmicks necessary to elevate the big set-pieces to something truly special and memorable. Especially Puss's duels against a mysterious bounty hunter are the highlights.While not entirely original, the Puss in Boots: The Last Wish combines the edgy humor of Shrek with the visual wonders of Into the Spiderverse and strings it along a relatively matured heroes journey coming to it's end tale that is closer to Logan than any other animation I can think off. Oh and just in case (not that I personally care much about it) there is zero political agenda to be found here to be a distraction of the perception."

            ","I was not at all interested in watching this film. As most of the animated movies from the major studios, especially from DreamWorks have been extremely dull and very samey. I can't think of a good one that I've seen since How To Train Your Dragon 2.But then I read all of the brilliant reviews and decided to give this one a go. And to my surprise, it was definitely a welcome change.Puss gets an existential crises when Death (AKA the Big Bad Wolf) comes for his last life after Puss has frivolously wasted his 8 other ones. It's interesting how dark it gets in these scenes, with Puss, who has never been afraid of death, gets scared and has a wakeup call. And learns to value life and the lives of others a bit more.Although it doesn't go as far as I thought it would when it came to heavy themes and character development, it certainly reminded me of the good old days of DreamWorks animation. So I absolutely consider this film a step in the right direction for this studio."

This was our journey.The stories have great connections romantically, between rivals and newcomers. The stories are about bringing all of us together despite what happened in the past.

            ","Puss in Boots: The Last Wish provides a fun adventure with meaningful lessons and tons of vibrant action. Donde está la Leche?The first 30 minutes of the movie are filled with your typical Puss as he sings, dances, and fights with his ever-so-charismatic yet cocky personality. He is quickly humbled when he finds out he needs to be more careful with his life, and this is where I was instantly hooked.Then enters the big bad wolf, from the wolf's menacing character design, skin trembling voice to the life-threatening fighting style. Wolf was one of the fantastic antagonists. I questioned whether this would be too much for the younger audience because the wolf's scenes struck fear in our beloved Puss. Although, as a viewer, we know nothing serious will happen, I felt this was a strong enough case for the plot.It didn't end there; we are introduced to various fairytale Characters. I am not going to spoil too much.Overall, the movie is fast-paced, has adult humor, and represents a love story, greed, and the beauty of friendship.Verdict: Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a fun time for the family; I would suggest watching it if you have younger ones. Even if you don't have younger ones and are a fan of the Shrek universe, it's worth the watch. Shoutout to Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek for there wonderful performances!"

            ","Seems that these days all the animated kids movies are more or less the same, with very few exceptions in recent years and it's grown tiresome. It's always potty humor and/or a weak storyline that either has adults rolling their eyes or falling asleep. This is one of the exceptions.With pitch perfect voice acting from all parts of the cast, to the way it makes old story concepts feel relatively fresh and funny again, this one is a winner. Best of all was the film doesn't rely on low brow, toilet humor to sell it's laughs. My favorite of which came from a certain play on Jiminy Cricket that I'm sure will have you in stitches.The animation had me a bit underwhelmed which is why I deduct a star, but that is subjective, so I leave that bit up to the viewer to decide for themselves. For me, when the action gets going, it felt glitchy and incomplete, but some people might enjoy that style.Overall, I highly recommend this one when it releases later this month.

We didn't get the usual Shrek style, Grimm fairytale cameos for no reason, on the contrary, they all played an important role in the story, and in the overall message.This movie also had me so emotional, no spoilers, but it's the way the creators handle their characters, with such sincerity and heart.Finally, the action, and the plot itself, it was go go go from the get go, i haven't seen a more well paced film all year, i think that is my favourite part of the dilm (Avatar 2 could take some notes)Overall, it was truly such a blast, so fun, heartfelt, FUNNY, genuine, with a great message at its core."

Seriously, this gives the first two films in the franchise alone a run for their money.Looks like The House That Shrek Built is finally back on top again.PS: That cricket with the spot-on Jimmy Stewart voice is one of the funniest things I've seen this year, whoever came up with him deserves a pay raise and a medal and free coffee and recognition from the United Nations."

After all, the film has very strong existential elements....things that would be mostly lost on kids.This film starts with the usual self-assured heroism you would expect in a Puss in Boots cartoon. But then something most unusual happens...after defying death again and again, Puss suddenly realizes his own mortality, as he realizes he's used up eight of his nine lives...and soon he will die once and for all! As a result, he's now afraid to be his old dashing self. So, he goes off in search of some magical wish...in the hopes that he can regain his previous lives. But, not surprisingly, along the way he discovers so much more.The animation is lovely and the story quite enjoyable. There really isn't much to complain about with this story...it's well made and hard not to like.

            ","In an age when movie and TV franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (I'm looking at you, Disney), I don't think anyone was expecting much from Puss In Boots: The Last Wish - certainly not I.After the first 5 minutes, I knew this was something special.Firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from Arkane and Enter The Spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. The 2D elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.The music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).The dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. Not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling I think I've ever seen. In a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. The cast do a great job of selling them too. Goldi and the bears come out with brilliant British-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.And then there's the wolf. This character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. His style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, I'm serious).At a time when Disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - Dreamworks have taken on the mantle.It made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. Partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. You might think I'm overselling it, but Hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.There are those that say that Hollywood is done - I know I do. But Dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

-Very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-Jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-Surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-Is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-Fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.Adorable Characters/Feel
-New characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-Fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-The feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-Has that element of Shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.The Animation
-It's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy DreamWorks does so well.-The design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-The world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that I certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-And it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-Overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than Disney for the blend of real and cartoons.The Voice Acting:
-Many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-Mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that SNL like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. He own the Horner character and brought some of the best lines.-Wagner Moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the Big-Bad Wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-Though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-Pugh is okay, not my favorite role as Goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. Note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-Guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy Is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. It does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-Hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-Banderas takes Boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the Spanish stereotype. And yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.The References/Jokes
-The stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of Shrek.-It's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-The fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-It feels like the first two Shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. Again, refreshing that they were able to step back.The Designs Changes To An Extent
-Creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-Like Into the Spiderverse? Good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that Puss does.-Not overused, which is very good for me.The Action At Times
-Shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-This movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-The ending fight shows the potential of what DreamWorks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes I've seen this year.The Heart
-Lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-The movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-There are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. That's hard to do in many things.-I love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-Have not felt this way since Shrek 2.DISLIKES:The Darkness
-It's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-Caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-Might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.Predictable
-The lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-The movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-Kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.Too Many Antagonists
-One of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-They do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-Need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-Several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.The Comedy Is Still Tapered
-It's starting to go back to Shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-Still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-Where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made Shrek, Shrek.-They took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.The Animation Changes At Times
-The animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-The comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the Spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-Just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.The Action Still Not Complete
--Shrek and Shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-This movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-The stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-They sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-Often was shorter than I wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. Chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.The VERDICT
I must say, Puss In Boots: The Last Wish was a much better film than when I walked in. Perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the Shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. Animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. It evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. And it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. This film is indeed a solid return to the world and I had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. However, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. Balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance I was looking for. The movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with Puss In Boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. And the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the Shrek that we saw in the first two movies. Still, I do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

            ","I did not expect the sequel to a decent spin-off Dreamworks film from over a decade ago to be one of the most poignant, introspective, genuinely hilarious, and heartwarming films of the year. But here we are.After an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, The Last Wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. The film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.The screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. And it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.What I also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.I adored this film. I think it's Dreamworks' best film since Megamind and it's easily the best true family film of the year."

            ","""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is as spry and light on its feet as its titular feline. The inherently alluring paradox of the swashbuckling kitty from the ""Shrek"" universe remains firmly in place 11 years after his first solo feature. He's a dashing adventurer, a charmer with the ladies, feared and renowned throughout the land -- but he's also unbearably adorable as he laps up milk from a shot glass with his pinky, sandpapery tongue. As always, the charismatic and sensitive Antonio Banderas finds just the right tone in exploring this furry animated figure's suave and silly sides. ""The Last Wish"" expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the Oscar-nominated 2011 original ""Puss in Boots."" Joining Banderas and his longtime friend and co-star Salma Hayek Pinault are Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and John Mulaney, among many others. They bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor. But of course, the fast-paced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director Joel Crawford and co-director Januel Mercado's film. The film's aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences, especially during the action sequences, but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight. From the moss growing on a fearsome forest giant to the shiny silkiness of Puss' whiskers blowing in the wind, ""The Last Wish"" offers a variety of eye-popping details. And it frequently features dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves to transition from past to present or one scene to the next. But the film also manages to convey messages of selflessness and teamwork in a way that doesn't feel heavy-handed or cloying. And the stellar voice performances and dazzling visuals keep things so engaging you won't need a laser pointer or a catnip-stuffed mouse toy to entertain you."

            ","CS Lewis once said a children's story that only appeals to children is not a good children's film in the least. I can think of plenty of crummy kids' movies that illustrate the point, but I'd rather bring up a positive example-- PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH.I cannot believe I am saying this about a Shrek spinoff, but this movie really is that good. It works on so many levels: as a high-speed comedy, all the jokes land, but as a story about mortality and the meaning of life, this film is oddly compelling and mature. The plot literally involves Puss running from the personification of death, hoping to cling to his life. In between the funny scenes, I was actually moved by the existential crisis of this cartoon cat. That's no small feat.This is truly a movie kids and adults can cherish."

The animation is brilliant, characters are charming, pacing is tight, very funny and the action is excellent. Not to mention there is a ton of heart. If I were to nitpick I think one of the antagonists trumps the other. One is played for more comedic purposes while the other is an Intimidating physical presence for boots to contend with. The Last Wish has something for everyone and it's probably one of the better animated movies I've seen in sometime. I really don't want to get into the story to avoid spoilers because the movie was a lot of fun, and it's best to go into it fresh. If anyone is considering taking their family to see the Last Wish like I did then The Last Wish is an easy recommendation. 100% worth the money. Two thumbs up for team friendship."

            ","The last ""Puss In Boots"" movie was made 11 years ago, as well as the last film the ""Shrek"" franchise, so surely they couldn't make something really great again, right? The story is pretty standard, as Puss In Boots is down to his last life and tries to get a wish on a magic star. It seriously has some of the best action I've seen in a long time. I don't even think this film qualifies as a comedy. It really is more like a straightforward action flick. Even its first five minutes are nothing but nonstop action from Frame 1 to Frame...whatever.This film does not take place before the Shrek films. We get to see some brief flashbacks with Shrek himself, albeit only for a few seconds. The villains are Big Jack Horner, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and a wolf. I believe a poster called this character the Big Bad Wolf, but he isn't that, even if he's technically based on him (he's actually DEATH). Every one of these villains are unique with their own motivations. Every minute makes me eager to find out what happens next.So...who does get the wish in the end? Nobody! Everyone (except Big Jack Horner) realizes they had what they wanted after awhile. It even begins with another sequel hook with Puss In Boots going back to Far Far Away Land. Another Shrek/Puss In Boots movie? If it has such amazing cel shading animation with the best CGI of all, it deserves as many films as possible! ****"

            ","Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) becomes a popular folk hero in his country. After his latest conquest of a giant monster, he was killed by a freak accident with a church bell. When he woke up, Puss realized that he already spent eight of his nine lives, and that he only had one more life to live. At first he did not think it was a big deal, but a traumatic encounter with a sinister-looking Wolf (Wagner Moura) made Puss decide to retire from adventures.While living the life of a spoiled lazy lap cat, Puss learned about a Wishing Star from the family of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo) who were looking for it. Puss decided to search for the Star himself in order to wish for his nine lives back. Along with Puss on his quest were his old flame Kitty Softpaws (Selma Hayek) and a nameless little orphan therapy dog (Harvey Guillen).This sequel to the first ""Puss in Boots"" solo spin-off movie came out 11 years after the original. There is a very evident difference that can be noted in the style of its animation. On top of the 3D computer-generated images of the characters, there is now an additional 2D artistic style as if they were hand-painted (first seen in ""The Bad Guys""), especially noted most prominently in the character of the Wolf, and even in Puss during their showdown fight scenes.The voice work of the actors really captured the personalities of the characters. Antonio Banderas's voice had the bravado, arrogance and charisma of Puss, whom we've known and loved since he made his first appearance in ""Shrek 2"" (2004). Selma Hayek lends her sexy sassiness to the voice of the skillful thief Kitty Softpaws, who held a grudge against Puss. Florence Pugh's characteristic raspiness was easily recognizable in Goldilocks's voice.Like before, the characters Puss encounters were all fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters. The choice for main antagonist was Jack Horner, the boy who sat in the corner eating his pies, but he was not little here anymore. He was not as famous as others, so some kids may need a review of his rhyme to refamiliarize. There were a trove of Disney character references you'll have fun identifying, from Mary Poppins, Alice in Wonderland and Jiminy Cricket.Very notable in this latest Dreamworks release is the darkness of the plot, which was also reflected in the artwork styles and situations depicted. Only in trickles, but this must be the first time blood was seen in a Dreamworks animated film. The language and humor used was also more mature, even with some assumed expletives bleeped out. As the topic of death played a major part in the story, scenes with the Wolf can be very scary for little kids. 8/10.PS: The new DreamWorks Animation opening logo precedes this film. It was quite nostalgic to see the DreamWorks boy seeing famous DreamWorks characters old an new -- like Toothless, Po, Boss Baby, a Troll, the Bad Guys and of course, Shrek with Fiona and Donkey -- as his crescent moon flew him around in space before settling in its place."

            ","This is genuinely one of my favorite films of the year. I hope it gets real recognition and people don't dismiss it as ""just an animated film"".I've always liked DreamWorks films, with my favorite being How to Train Your Dragon 2, but after rewatching the first Puss in Boots movie, I wasn't expecting much for this sequel, eleven years after. I like the first installment for sure but it's certainly a lot simpler in story than I'd prefer. This one however, has such a rich emotional aspect to it that I truly felt something during it.There were also certain scenes involving a wolf character that were quite creepy. I think kids will have a lot of fun with this movie, but at the core this is a story about family and understanding the value of things and/or people who are in front of you already. And that's a message that every person of any age can get something out of. The voice acting is top-notch and the animation is such a ridiculous step-up from the last time. This is such a cool direction to take this sequel into and I dug it all the way through.There's really not much negative to say other than the ending feels like it should have been slightly more concise, but that's it.

            ","I did not have many expectations going into this with my daughter, I've seen the main Shrek movies but noon of the other Puss in Boot's spin-offs. I was shocked at how good a movie this was when the credits rolled!The story itself is functional, but all characters are given meaningful and relatable arcs. Between the melanchonic Puss reaching the end of his days as a great hero, his always positive dog sidekick and the 3 antagonistic parties trying to reach the magical macguffin there is a lot going on and none of it feels forced in.The two greatest assets the movie brings is it's humor and the stunning action scenes. First of all, this movie has bite, it is back to the tone of the first Shrek movie with lots of jokes that are working on a children and adult level of understanding. While the story is easy to follow for kids, the themes explored are relatively mature and will keep adults engaged.Secondly, while Disney/Pixar movies lately fail to make action exiting with their polished CGI style, Puss in boots goes full Into the Spiderverse once a fight breaks out. Glorious 12 frames per second, hyper stylized with all the filters and gimmicks necessary to elevate the big set-pieces to something truly special and memorable. Especially Puss's duels against a mysterious bounty hunter are the highlights.While not entirely original, the Puss in Boots: The Last Wish combines the edgy humor of Shrek with the visual wonders of Into the Spiderverse and strings it along a relatively matured heroes journey coming to it's end tale that is closer to Logan than any other animation I can think off. Oh and just in case (not that I personally care much about it) there is zero political agenda to be found here to be a distraction of the perception."

I can't think of a good one that I've seen since How To Train Your Dragon 2.But then I read all of the brilliant reviews and decided to give this one a go. And to my surprise, it was definitely a welcome change.Puss gets an existential crises when Death (AKA the Big Bad Wolf) comes for his last life after Puss has frivolously wasted his 8 other ones. It's interesting how dark it gets in these scenes, with Puss, who has never been afraid of death, gets scared and has a wakeup call. And learns to value life and the lives of others a bit more.Although it doesn't go as far as I thought it would when it came to heavy themes and character development, it certainly reminded me of the good old days of DreamWorks animation.

He is quickly humbled when he finds out he needs to be more careful with his life, and this is where I was instantly hooked.Then enters the big bad wolf, from the wolf's menacing character design, skin trembling voice to the life-threatening fighting style. Wolf was one of the fantastic antagonists. I questioned whether this would be too much for the younger audience because the wolf's scenes struck fear in our beloved Puss. Although, as a viewer, we know nothing serious will happen, I felt this was a strong enough case for the plot.It didn't end there; we are introduced to various fairytale Characters. I am not going to spoil too much.Overall, the movie is fast-paced, has adult humor, and represents a love story, greed, and the beauty of friendship.Verdict: Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a fun time for the family; I would suggest watching it if you have younger ones.

            ","In an age when movie and TV franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (I'm looking at you, Disney), I don't think anyone was expecting much from Puss In Boots: The Last Wish - certainly not I.After the first 5 minutes, I knew this was something special.Firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from Arkane and Enter The Spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. The 2D elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.The music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).The dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. Not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling I think I've ever seen. In a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. The cast do a great job of selling them too. Goldi and the bears come out with brilliant British-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.And then there's the wolf. This character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. His style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, I'm serious).At a time when Disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - Dreamworks have taken on the mantle.It made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. Partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. You might think I'm overselling it, but Hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.There are those that say that Hollywood is done - I know I do. But Dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

            ","You heard me! My wife and I just got back from the theater, and absolutely LOVED this movie, even more than any of the Shrek movies and the first Puss in Boots!This movie has SO MUCH to love, from BEAUTIFUL visuals/action to consistent humor that actually had us laughing to engaging characters, both old and new. Such a fun time, and so worth seeing in the theaters, though we'll definitely be picking up a copy once it's out on DVD!Without giving too much away, there are several different antagonists in this movie that scratch all the bad-guy itches, covering the spectrum from totally hateable to horrifying to relatable and sympathetic. A great cast! Also, the magical world they came up with for this movie was awesome, with some really cool/unique features!At first, we were a little worried about the dog character, neither of us being big fans of daffy sidekicks, but we were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves rooting for him! He's hilarious, and that's coming from a cat-lover!Several callbacks to the first Puss in Boots movie made this one feel less like a spin-off than a worthy standalone franchise, and the movie was PACKED with magical references that all ages will be able to recognize and enjoy.Do yourself a favor and free a few hours for this one!! A rare 10 from me!!"

            ","LIKES:Pacing
-Very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-Jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-Surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-Is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-Fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.Adorable Characters/Feel
-New characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-Fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-The feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-Has that element of Shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.The Animation
-It's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy DreamWorks does so well.-The design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-The world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that I certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-And it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-Overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than Disney for the blend of real and cartoons.The Voice Acting:
-Many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-Mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that SNL like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. He own the Horner character and brought some of the best lines.-Wagner Moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the Big-Bad Wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-Though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-Pugh is okay, not my favorite role as Goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. Note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-Guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy Is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. It does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-Hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-Banderas takes Boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the Spanish stereotype. And yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.The References/Jokes
-The stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of Shrek.-It's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-The fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-It feels like the first two Shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. Again, refreshing that they were able to step back.The Designs Changes To An Extent
-Creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-Like Into the Spiderverse? Good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that Puss does.-Not overused, which is very good for me.The Action At Times
-Shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-This movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-The ending fight shows the potential of what DreamWorks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes I've seen this year.The Heart
-Lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-The movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-There are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. That's hard to do in many things.-I love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-Have not felt this way since Shrek 2.DISLIKES:The Darkness
-It's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-Caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-Might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.Predictable
-The lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-The movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-Kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.Too Many Antagonists
-One of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-They do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-Need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-Several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.The Comedy Is Still Tapered
-It's starting to go back to Shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-Still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-Where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made Shrek, Shrek.-They took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.The Animation Changes At Times
-The animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-The comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the Spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-Just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.The Action Still Not Complete
--Shrek and Shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-This movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-The stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-They sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-Often was shorter than I wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. Chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.The VERDICT
I must say, Puss In Boots: The Last Wish was a much better film than when I walked in. Perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the Shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. Animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. It evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. And it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. This film is indeed a solid return to the world and I had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. However, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. Balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance I was looking for. The movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with Puss In Boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. And the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the Shrek that we saw in the first two movies. Still, I do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

            ","Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede? The third act defies any sort of logic.But again, it was worth watching."

            ","There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film."

            ","I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

            5/10
            ","Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do. Save your money, and don't waste your time on this vastly overrated release from a vastly overrated filmmaker."

            ","Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend."

Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned."

            1/10
            ","It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have."

There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it."

Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film."

            ","One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end."

            ","I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more."

            ","I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success."

The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning.

To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in.

In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there.

This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

            ","Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend."

Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have."

            ","Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it."

            ","Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film."

            ","One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end."

            ","I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does.

I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared.

To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in.

In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there.

I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film."

            ","I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility. Too much, too brash, too over-the-top, too silly, too boring.Story not told well, whatever it was. I sure don't care."

            ","Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do. Save your money, and don't waste your time on this vastly overrated release from a vastly overrated filmmaker."

            ","Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend."

There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart.

","23 December 2023","
            1/10
            ","It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have."

            ","Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it."

            ","Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film."

            ","One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end."

That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more."

Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success."

            ","It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

            ","The movie was quite enjoyable, albeit slightly too ambitious. It seemed to struggle in balancing between an aristocratic setting, lacking the depth found in works like 'Brideshead Revisited' or Alan Hollinghurst's 'The Line of Beauty', and a psychological thriller aspect, which, while entertaining, came across as overly sensational and somewhat lacking in credibility. At times, the plot developments were so outlandish that they were more amusing than serious. Saltburn was on the verge of being a masterpiece with its wealth of excellent content. It's still a worthwhile watch, despite some superficial elements and a feeling that Fennell and the screenwriter didn't fully explore their characters, choosing sensationalism instead.

            ","They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down."

","24 November 2023",NA,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you. But if you prefer to be allowed to concentrate on the unfolding tale of immorality without the shock and awe, then TTMR is a far better movie."

Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede? The third act defies any sort of logic.But again, it was worth watching."

I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical.

            ","Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do. Save your money, and don't waste your time on this vastly overrated release from a vastly overrated filmmaker."

            ","Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend."

            1/10
            ","It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have."

That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good.

I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it."

Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film."

            ","One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end."

That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more."

            ","I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success."

To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in.

In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there.

I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

            ","Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend."

            1/10
            ","It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth.

Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have."

            ","Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it."

            ","Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film."

            ","One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end."

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

            ","I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more."

            ","I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success."

The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning.

To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in.

In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you. But if you prefer to be allowed to concentrate on the unfolding tale of immorality without the shock and awe, then TTMR is a far better movie."
