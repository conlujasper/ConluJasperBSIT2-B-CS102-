","granted, the meg is dumb. jason statham takes on a giant shark from below what scientists thought was the bottom of the marianas trench. you know how it's going to end because jason statham doesn't ever lose. even when faced with one or more enormous sharksgreat special effects cover for some sketchy acting - not that anyone watches these sorts of movies for acting - and some of the expected action movie tropes (like my personal favourite: someone getting killed gloating about their victory after they think the threat is over) in what is a fun film if you like giant creature movies and jason statham. one of those movies to not over-think.definitely not a masterpiece, but definitely enjoyable."
"2","the meg 2","top_dawg_critic",2018-08-09,6," the meg was meh
","16 reviews, and half are all a fake high-rated single review of this film - makes me shake my head why the producers think their viewers are dumb and wont see thru the fakes. all it takes is one click to see the only single review from the poster. don't get me started on the moronic review from halil-92019: ""playing computer games makes kids smarter?""this film had it's moments, but it was nothing spectacular. the best parts were the cinematography, visuals and directing. the story itself has been done so many times, making the shark prehistoric doesn't add anything to the imagination. the writers needed to up this a few levels and not rely on statham (who was great as always) to bring in the moviegoers into the theater. the 103 min length felt a little long, but the pacing good enough to keep you interested, although it was missing that constant extra thrill and suspense i expected. instead, i cringed at the cheesy 1 liners and poor attempt at humor - most executed at the wrong time.it's an honest deserving score of only 6/10 from me."
"3","the meg 2","thelittlesongbird",2018-08-12,4," mega mediocrity
","my main reasons for seeing 'the meg' were that there are classic shark films out there (there is an obvious example that won't be named by means of fairness in the review but has been mentioned elsewhere) and that it was part of my many quests to see as many 2018 films as possible. it did look from the cover that it would be some kind of guilty pleasure fun, which was my ideal kind of film for the day.apparently 'the meg' had a lot of studio interference, meaning that what was initially intended (and from the sounds of it what was initially intended would have made it a much better film) was not seen in the film, and it shows in the final product. wanted some guilty pleasure film, a kind of turn-the-brain-off-at-the-door sort of film. instead, 'the meg' turned out to be poorly written and mostly devoid of tension and fun, one where one is rooting for the shark than any of the human characters. is it better than any of the shark-creature films from syfy and the asylum? oh yes, so much better, now those are mostly abominations. that doesn't stop 'the meg' from being potential unfulfilled. there are positives. 'the meg' does start off reasonably well with a sense of unsettlement and the climactic scene is pretty entertaining. the best character, kid you not, is the shark which had personality and one that was not too scary or goofy. it's pretty decent visually, nicely shot in particular, the music fits well and jason statham brings charisma to his role and is believable in that aspect.on the other hand, the rest of the acting is a mess. worst of all is a dreadful bingbing li, with a character that bores and annoys and approaching the character in a way that's completely wrong and out of kilter with everything else. none of the characters are well written, too bland to be interesting and too annoying with dumb decision making to be likeable. a few of them are completely unnecessary. development is zero.special effects are uneven, some times they are pretty good and at other times they look so artificial and like they were made in haste. the action scenes with the shark are too few and they are generally devoid of tension, scares and suspense, ruined by unintentional humour, tameness, stupid goofiness and lack of sense, even when taking it for what it is meant to be. the story is as shallow and predictable as can be, with the pace dulling significantly outside of the shark action and indicative of padding out the already overlong by 15-20 minute running time. faring worst is the script, which is even more atrocious than bingbing li's acting, bad enough to warrant a paragraph of its own. far too much talk, very clumsy attempts at humour (unintentional and the cringe-worthy intentional), a good deal of waffle some of which adds nothing, a lot of ridiculousness and implausibility, excessive sentimentality, muddled and clunky scientific exposition and some of it perplexes in terms of clarity too.in summary, has good things but ruined primarily by the script. 4/10 bethany cox"
"4","the meg 2","averagejoesdriveinpodcast",2018-08-12,7," a fun theater-going experience!
","i will be upfront with anyone who hasn't watched this yet. mindset-wise if you go in thinking more along the lines of deep blue sea rather than jaws you'll probably have a good time. if you want serious, deep storylines and oscar-caliber performances you probably should avoid it because this isn't it. also on that note, why the hell would you go see this movie in the first place if you want that?this movie is just stupid fun with tons of funny moments. the comedy aspect of it actually caught me off guard. i expected a few funny moments here and there like most films of this ilk, but this is just straight up funny throughout. there are plenty of grandiose action sequences. a character you just flat out hate because he's such an atypical ass-hat and some beautiful cgi. the film itself is very well shot and i even had a hard time telling whether the fxs were practical or cgi in spots. they blended stuff together well. i thought the acting was solid for what this film is. it's about what i expected. like anything, there were a few things here and there that could have been better. but, none of those things were enough to hinder my enjoyment of it. i personally would have liked to see it be a tad bit gorier. i think that might have pushed this up a notch especially with the type of story this. on the other hand, that's more of a preference than an actual hindrance type thing. this was exactly what i wanted out of a summer blockbuster style film. it's a fun theater-going experience. it's the type of movie you want to see on the big screen with a great sound system. what i would consider a perfect popcorn flick.my rating: 7/10"
"5","the meg 2","ripleyspussy",2018-08-10,7," honest thoughts on the film by jason statham and director jon turteltaub
","although i've just watched this film, this is not a review in the traditional sense. i just wanted to make this clear, because i don't mean to mislead anybody. rather than giving you my own two cents (well, i will give you those, but later), i would like to let the people directly involved in the meg share their - refreshingly honest - thoughts on it, because they had some very interesting things to say that helped me better understand what i'd just seen. let's start with jason statham's recent interview with frosty weintraub. you'll notice jason tries to be diplomatic, but he has a very hard time concealing the fact that he's not too happy with the finished product:""the film changed a lot. the script was totally different. there was so many different ... sometimes you just go: how did it happen? how did it go from this to this to this to that? i guess if you have the control to keep it a certain way you would, but you don't. they have so many people deciding on what action stays and what scenes stay. how the characters ... in the end they want to put something at the beginning. the whole thing at the beginning where i *spoiler* do a rescue on a sub? that was not in the script that i read. that was all brand new stuff. good or bad, i'm just letting you know. but (originally) there was other stuff at the beginning that was ... i'm, you know. i'm just saying it was radically different.""""i guess in some ways your imagination and your own perception of what it's going to be is its worst enemy. john (turteltaub)'s interpretation of this is a fun end of summer movie. it's full of humor. he's put his very light-hearted way into it(...). it's a little bit more directed to a different taste of what my own is in terms of i like more gory adult stuff. you go: where's the effing blood?! it's like, there's a shark. i'm a lot older but i can't speak for what this film could possibly speak to a younger audience. i might have made a film that not many people wanted to see. i'm not a filmmaker.""""i'm sort of an actor that's going to portray a role. i go there but i've learned not to get too attached with your own idea of what something could be. i don't know. as an audience goer you're spared all of that sort of things that can ruin a movie for you. i think as you're involved in these films you get more and more critical and going: that bit there should have spent more money on the cg. that bit there they should have made that more gory. where's the other bit that was in the original? you get very critical.""and director jon turteltaub had this to add in a recent interview with a horror-oriented film site: ""i am so disappointed the film wasn't more bloody or disgusting. my wife is glad about it, and i'm glad my kids can see the movie, but the number of really horrifying, disgusting and bloody deaths we had lined up that we didn't get to do is tragic. we shot or even did a lot of visual effects for gory scenes. there was some really good sh√¨t that didn't survive to the final cut.""as statham and the director both alluded to in their interviews, apparently, during post-production the decision was made that the meg would have to be appropriate for teenagers, and the film was significantly re-cut. when turteltaub was asked if he would like to see his own, unrated version released, he said: ""yes. mine would have a lot gorier, but funnier, deaths for people. it's just awesome. killing people in movies is a lot of fun.""so there you have it folks, the star and the director seem none too pleased about studio mandated changes to their movie in their assessment of the theatrical cut. i've watched the film despite myself, and it's actually nowhere near as bad as i feared - it's fun in a harmless, forgettable kind of way - but what statham and turteltaub are implying is spot on: the whole film constantly teases you with unfulfilled potential. now let's hope we get the better version upon home release."
"6","the meg 2","uniqueparticle",2023-07-15,7," i'm not sure why i didn't review sooner
","i fairly enjoy this although i'd say jon turtletaub films have been better i don't get why this was basically launched into a black hole and chewed out into another dimension, i have fun. maybe meg 2 will do better at least critically. the meg is plenty entertaining at least enough for a decent rating maybe you could say jason statham has been in better but at least he's a professional swimmer that i appreciate anything done by the actor for sure! i love rainn wilson he's awesome in anything he's been in even when he's a numb skull that makes ridiculous mistakes. i do notice the dialogue is a bit of a mess that's probably part of the hate but i enjoy the meg for what it is, pretty good entertainment that you can have a nice treat with!"
"7","the meg 2","moviexclusive",2018-08-08,6," jason statham versus a 75-foot prehistoric shark - it's as simple, as cheesy, but as enjoyable as that
","the meg' is basically short for 'jason statham versus a 75-foot prehistoric shark', and if that doesn't sound like your idea of an exciting late-summer movie, then this slab of b-movie cheese is clearly not for you. oh yes, the science-fiction horror novel by steve alten on which this movie is based was precisely meant to be that sort of pulpy entertainment, and director jon turteltaub ensures that his adaptation is balanced squarely between self-awareness and self-seriousness, even though it does start off being more of the latter before tipping into more of the former.so it goes that our introduction to statham's deep-sea rescue diver jonas taylor is no laughing business: in the throes of his latest mission to save the crew of a nuclear submarine trapped at the bottom of the mariana trench, jonas is forced to sacrifice two of his own men inside the submarine after it is purportedly attacked by a giant creature which crushes its hull. jonas' account of the tragic event is disputed by another key member of his very own crew dr heller (robert taylor), and after being accused of suffering a psychological meltdown, he retreats to seclusion on a rustic island in thailand.five years later, jonas is given the opportunity to get even with the creature when he is approached by an old friend mac (cliff curtis) to lead an urgent operation to save his ex-wife lori (jessica mcnamee) and her two other crew mates stranded underwater in a deep sea submersible names origin off the chinese coast. mac and lori are part of a larger team on a modern research facility called mana one exploring if there is life beneath the depths of the ocean as we know it, and the first successful so-called 'insertion' (cue the geek joke delivered by masi oka and √≥lafur darri √≥lafsson) into the hydrothermal sphere at the bottom of the seabed brings the origin face to face with the titular super shark previously thought to be extinct.at first, jonas' history means he is greeted with scepticism by the team on board mana one, including chief oceanographer dr zhang minway (winston chao), his equally accomplished daughter suyin (li bingbing) and no less than jonas' former colleague dr heller himself. it goes without saying that jonas will quickly prove that he wasn't crazy after all, but after having also rescued suyin who had valiantly but foolhardily gone to try to rescue lori on her own, the two divorcees will begin to sketch the contours of a romance through some rare character moments, many of which also wisely draw on the precocious charms of suyin's eight-year-old daughter meiying (shuya sophia cai).it should come as no surprise that 'the meg' is built on a number of elaborate action-driven set-pieces mostly executed by mr statham, but it is also worthwhile acknowledging that turteltaub and his screenwriters (comprising of genre specialists dean georgaris and jon and erich hoeber) do give the characters just enough texture to craft some memorable scenes within these set-pieces. among the notable archetypes on display here are the self-absorbed financer morris (rainn wilson), the tough-as-nails independent female type jaxx (ruby rose), as well as the timid plus-sized african-american comic relief dj (page kennedy); and without saying who lives, who dies or how either way, these characters in their respective ways inject verve into some of the gloriously over-the-top sequences.these sequences of course dictate the course of the narrative, which sees the megalodon emerge from its hidden depths by some deus ex machina to travel hundreds of miles over open ocean to terrorise hundreds of summer-loving beachgoers at sanya bay. each one of the three distinct settings forms the backdrop of a significant encounter with the megalodon, with the latter two especially allowing statham to flex his physicality without being in any claustrophobic confine. more than simple logic, that explains why statham has to swim within 100 metres of the shark in order to fire a gps tracker at its dorsal fin, or dive below the surface to rescue suyin trapped within a shark cage, or in the film's pi√®ce de r√©sistance escape from a damaged submersible just in time to spear the shark in its eye.indeed, there's not a lot of common sense involved, though nothing so exaggerated as to qualify irrevocably as parody. the operative word here is fun, and on that account, 'the meg' definitely scores. statham carries each one of these outlandish scenes with a knowing wink, and his ability to deliver the intentionally corny one-liners is matchless. on his part, turteltaub gleefully seizes every opportunity to emphasise the relative size of the competition between statham and the meg, and patiently waits till the climax to unleash all restraint and let the campiness overflow - there in sanya bay, you have young males ogling at the opposite sex on separate floating platforms before being forcibly rammed together by the marauding shark, a man in an inflatable bubble float trying to roll over his fellow swimmers before his bubble is literally burst by the shark, and a plump and pampered young boy holding a paddle pop getting his just desserts after defying his mother's caution not to go into the ocean.it probably won't escape you that the movie is one of the high-profile us-china co-productions this year, and while that is reflected in the locations and choice of co-stars, the pleasures here still seem more culturally attuned to hollywood sensitivities. to its credit, 'the meg' never comes off being sillier than it intentionally puts itself out to be, and boasts more than its fair share of entertaining man-versus-enormous-shark sequences. but hey, we thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was worth, and considering that the movie has been stuck in development for over a decade, we'd add that we couldn't have seen it any other way than 'jason statham versus a 75-foot prehistoric shark'."
"8","the meg 2","mldintn",2019-04-11,7," fun flick
","you have a hot lead (statham) , a giant shark, bad acting, a villain that gets what he deserves, one liners, and a decent plot. what else do you need for a fun flick. while this was no master piece, it was still fun to watch. the shark effects were pretty good, not awful like the movies on the sci fi channel. and how can you not love a scene in which someone jumps in the water with a 100 ft shark looking to hit it with a tracker, or inject poison. the final death scene of the meg was cool too. but the smaller sharks were worse cgi effects.final verdict: if you love sharks, this is a must watch. it's fun and entertaining."
"9","the meg 2","mickyg333",2023-10-20,5," statham is gold
","7.4 stars.i rate all movies by entertainment value first and foremost. is this a cheesy film? of course. is it as good as jaws? nobody is trying to accomplish such an absurdity.this is a story about a very courageous and heroic guy played by statham who is called out on a rescue because he is the only man for the job. he also has to prove it to a bunch of scientists just once for them to realize ""oh yeah, this guy is the best"". and so he has to do some crazy rescue stunts, putting his life in danger over and over.the marine scientists have discovered a megalodon, which is basically a prehistoric shark that is 5 times the size of a great white (give or take). they have explored beyond the boundaries of where humans have ever been and these dinosaur-like sharks inhabit that depth of the trench. now they have to contend with the shark(s).'the meg' fits the bill for any creature feature film, but the bonus is jason statham. in my opinion, he alone raises the bar for this type of film at least a couple of levels beyond most of the generic movies and this is a refreshing take on the genre. a few of the characters are developed just enough to like. there is also a bit of comic relief and some shady characters too. all the ingredients are present and accounted for. this is an enjoyable ride, no concentration or deep thinking is necessary."
"10","the meg 2","austin-65005",2018-08-09,7," it's everything you would guess
","look, this movie wasn't bad... but it wasn't great either... everything that comes with a shark movie was here. a cheesy storyline that bounced around a lot, and some great action sequences wth the shark. jason statham was the same as he usually is, stone faced and serious. rainn wilson did a great job with his part. but other than that, nothing really sticks out."
"11","the meg 2","jhmoondance",2021-11-13,5," mega jaws
","this movie was similar to jaws apart from the under-sea action. the megaladon was actually very realistic n the cgi was amazing.the actors did a great job with their characters n were all likeable.there were some tense moments n a little bit of suspense but overall it was a straight up film.the cinematography was brilliant.everything was pretty much predictable n the ending was too.i recommend this movie if you like creature features, action n suspense."
"12","the meg 2","ba_harrison",2019-11-08,1," not quite a megalodon't, but not the mega success i had hoped for.
","i first saw jaws in 1975 at the tender age of seven; it scared the hell out of me then, and is an exhilarating ride to this day. the meg, on the other hand, is a formulaic, big-budget b-movie that fails to get the pulse pounding, despite it's prehistoric shark being three times as big as bruce, spielberg's iconic great white.jason statham stars as deep-sea rescue expert jonas taylor, who is brought to a high-tech facility to help save three scientists who have become trapped in a sub at the bottom of the sea after being attacked by something unseen. jonas's mission results in the successful extraction of two of the boffins (one of whom is his ex-wife), but in doing so, he releases a very hungry megalodon from the depths.directed by jon turteltaub (cool runnings, national treasure), the meg is slick but completely vapid popcorn entertainment that proves that bigger isn't necessarily better. the plot offers few surprises and little in the way of imagination, and statham is his usual stoic self, indistinguishable from any of his other movie roles. bingbing li adds a bit of glamour as pretty scentist suyin (this is an american/chinese co-production, so the film features plenty of asian actors) and rainn wilson is fun as billionaire morris (destined to become shark fodder), but most of the cast are forgettable. as far as the other stars are concerned - the megs (for there are more than one) - they are fairly impressive cgi creations, but this being a 12a certificate, their attacks don't result in anything too graphic.as a big fan of shark movies, i had such high hopes when the meg was first announced; what a shame that the finished film is so unremarkable and lacking in bite."
"13","the meg 2","mhorg2018",2018-08-13,3," stupid enough to be on the syfy channel
","how did this not end up on the syfy channel? this is one hackneyed, stupid movie. basically while exploring the marianas trench, a gigantic shark, the megaldon or some such is released. previously to this a deep rescue submersible encounters it and the main guy, jason stratham is ignored. he gets called back to rescue others which is when this stupid movie really gets rolling. the effects are so-so changing from scene to scene. the best thing is when the little yorkie who goes for a swim survives. this movie is a great video for how not to remain safe on any type of boat. no one wears a life vest, or any other survival gear. the story is barely above the worthless garbage shown on the syfy channel. this is really just one stupid movie. i'm sure it'll show up on tv in a matter of months, if not weeks."
"14","the meg 2","dpb0402",2018-08-16,5," worst dialogue ever.
","honestly this film has not only the worst dialogue of any movie this summer/year. it is the worst dialogue i have ever heard in a bad movie ever. deep blue sea, the shallows, and jaws 3 all had better dialogue than this cliche title.the room directed by tommy wiseau and this movie go hand and hand for some of the garbage lines and pacing. halfway through this movie when it appears to be over, i wished it was finally over, however i knew that there was no way they would end it there.save your money. this will be streamable in 4 months and on sale for $15."
"15","the meg 2","jared_andrews",2018-08-13,6," mostly a mega-disappointment
","there's a scene during the meg when i expected a character to say, ""you're gonna need a bigger boat."" sadly, no one does. so, in a story that's so clearly reminiscent of jaws, an opportunity for a moment of self-aware fun is wasted. it's emblematic of the entire movie - all the pieces are in place for something entertaining to occur, but the payoff never comes. the meg has all the ingredients needed for a summer blockbuster and then some. it features a megalodon, a 90-foot-long prehistoric mega-shark that also happens to be one of the most perfectly named animals ever, jason statham, one of the marquee action movie stars of our time, and rainn wilson, who gave us one of the funniest television characters of the past 20 years: dwight schrute on the office.take my money now. as renee zellweger says in jerry maguire, ""you had me at mega-shark."" boasting this embarrassment of riches, the movie practically screams fun. with all these assets at their disposal, it's easy to envision filmmakers bringing to life this concept's illustrious potential on the big screen. there could be actors hamming it up in a stupendously silly summer epic flooded with ridiculous one-liners and ""are they really doing this?"" moments. it could be glorious.there's just one problem: that's not what this movie is. rather than lean into the absurdity and have a little fun, the meg tries to sell a story about a tortured man of the sea who is now seeking revenge on the animal that attacked him (no, herman melville did not receive a screenwriting credit). the story is not affecting enough to elicit any noteworthy emotional responses, it's not smart enough to be scientifically sound and it's not over-the-top enough to reach a level of pure popcorn entertainment. everything comes up short. instead of a towering tidal wave, it brings only a gentle rolling tide.
 
jason statham plays the revenge-seeking seaman named captain ahab, erm, i mean, jonas taylor. after he was called crazy for believing that a giant unseen animal attacked his underwater vessel, he's summoned back into action by billionaire doofus, morris (wilson), who funds a deep-sea research facility. morris needs jonas to save his team of researchers, who are currently stranded at the bottom of the mariana trench, where they hoped to discover hidden marine life.the megalodon, or as his friends call him, the meg, eventually emerges from the depths and wreaks havoc on the facility and all sorts of fancy exploration vehicles because, apparently, megalodons love the taste of metal. the meg later swaggers his way over to sanya bay in china, where he can capture local swimmers and the film's producers can capture the foreign movie-viewing market. it takes 90 minutes of unnecessary scientific exposition to reach an enjoyable stretch. the plot revolves around a 90-foot prehistoric shark reappearing in 2018 - there's no reason to attempt to make any of this seem plausible. in addition to the superfluous fake science scenes, there's an insufferable amount of undeserved emotionality. again, this story should focus on the giant shark, not half-hearted romances and pseudo-dramatic deaths. the eye-roll-worthy sentimentality clashes with the adjacent raucous action and silly jokes (yes, there are some of those, just not nearly enough). weepy drama has no place here. this should be a zero-tears movie.it's hard to tell exactly what the filmmakers were going for; the goal should have been so obvious, but there's clearly uncertainty, which explains why the tone is so uneven. the result is a mixed bag with too much emphasis on the wrong elements. it's not quite a mega-disappointment, but it's definitely a missed opportunity."
"16","the meg 2","leofwine_draca",2018-12-16,7," moderately entertaining
","the meg is the latest movie in hollywood's obsession with killer shark movies; this ranks beneath the likes of jaws and even deep blue sea, although it's moderately entertaining as a one-off watch. if you're looking for quality in the genre these days then i'd recommend going for the lower-budgeted likes of the reef or bait. the meg follows the fortunes of the crew of a scientific base in the middle of the ocean when they accidentally reawaken a megalodon from its prehistoric slumber; this massive shark proceeds to dominate and eat all and sundry. this is a co-production between hollywood and china, so expect chinese supporting actors and more than a little propaganda. jason statham does his action man routine with ease and is given able support from an up-for-it cast, while the action scenes are certainly larger-than-life, although with all the cgi they're hardly realistic. an undercurrent of humour makes some of the more ludicrous scenes easier to swallow. it's hardly great, but it does the job as a piece of switch-off-the-brain viewing."

","i honestly really enjoyed this movie. at one point, it was anticlimactic but then a twist which renewed it's self.if you have seen other jason statham movies, then you know what to expect. this is a bit different than his other roles - there is no fighting military or marital arts style.the movie has some cute moments, sad moments and a lot of suspense, beautiful graphics, dark comedy. there are a few moments of 'why would you do that?' or 'that's not how that works' but it is an enjoyable flick and i will watch it again.this is a break up from other shark attack movies, or movies like this. there are some characters (one in particular) that don't fit. there are even some stereotypical concepts from other movies incorporated that were a bit rushed. (trying to stay away from spoilers)character development was rushed and we get our typical back story of the hero's journey which makes up just about all movies and books, stories of overcoming odds.

"31","the meg 2","stevenrotherforth",2018-08-11,8," the meg in 4dx. probably the most fun i've ever had at the cinema.
","the megforget star wars or the avengers or even rocky balboa and ethan hunt. for me the meg is the movie i've been most excited about in 2018.
""why?"" you may ask.
well about twenty years ago i was in my local bookstore when a certain paperback caught my attention. a blue cover with a luminescent white shark. 
the name meg in bold letters.
i was intrigued. my brain tried to piece the two things together.
an odd name to call a shark i thought. so after reading the synopsis i was hooked. i love sharks, whales and dinosaurs, practically anything with huge teeth and the ability to swallow you whole.
i read the entire book in a matter of days and was totally bowled over by steve altens novel.
it was hugely entertaining with some fantastic action set pieces that would look fantastic on the big screen. 
within the first few pages a t-rex gets devoured by a meg. how cool is that?
come on make the movie for pete's sake!!!
something on the cover had me excited. 
""soon to be a major motion picture!""
what a movie altens story would make.
time went by and still no megalodon movie.
i've waited patiently, sat through countless crappy imitations and rip offs but there's been no attempt to put altens work on the big screen.fast forward to 2018 and finally the meg has surfaced.
""about bloody time!""
sure like many other meg-heads out there i've had my concerns.
especially after reading that the movie is only loosely based on steve altens exciting novel.
but then again the movie jaws was only loosely based on peter benchley's novel and we all know how that turned out.so was the movie adaptation of the meg a success?
well as a faithful adaptation of the novel the answer is no! this is my only real gripe with the movie.
but as a piece of fun throw away cinema it's an absolute yes!
jon turteltaub's movie is a fast paced thrill ride from start to finish with just enough inspiration taken from the novel to keep meg-heads like me invested. as i mentioned, a more faithful adaptation would have been welcome and i believe critics would have been much kinder if the source material was followed more closely.
however this movie is accessible to all as the gore and violence has been toned down. 
perhaps the meg would have been even better with an r rating but i understand that the studio needs to make as much money as possible.
with a budget of $130 million i can see why the studio executives have played it safe.
this is a huge amount of money to throw at a giant prehistoric shark b movie.
i had my doubts with the casting of jason statham too in the lead role as navy submersible pilot jonas taylor. 
back in the 90's when i expected this movie to be released i always envisioned nicholas cage in the role. don't ask me why, every meg-head will have their preferred choice but i have to say that statham was absolutely fantastic. 
he really is the 80's action star stuck in the year 2018. 
statham's interaction with the little girl played by shuya sophia cai was adorable and then the next minute he's off being the uber cool hero. 
jason statham has elevated his status to best action star in the world today with his turn in the meg.
i also enjoyed the rest of the cast and the comedic interplay between them all helped lift the tension.
i must admit i was hugely disappointed that we didn't get to see the meg chow down on that t rex! if we get a sequel please warner bros you must include this. every meg-head around the globe will explode into a puddle of excitement.but what about the true star of the show?the cgi effects are superb and the meg looks very real.
the choice not to have her luminescent was the right one.
i know that it goes against the book and i along with many a meg-head frowned upon the decision at first, but i now believe meg would have looked unnatural with her white glow.
in the movie she has a wonderful prehistoric texture to her hide.
this makes her look gnarly and ancient. only the odd scene, particularly her introductory one looked a little fake.
the cgi wizards have managed to capture her natural movements.
the underwater scene when she is chasing jonas as he's being reeled back to the boat looked very realistic.
as did the scene when the meg swims underneath a unsuspecting paddle boarder.it's obvious to see where most of the budget went but still other elements of production have not suffered.
cinematography is wonderful. the meg goes from dark and murky to eye popping colourful.
the opening submarine rescue sequence sets a particular tone before the colour palette changes depending on the environment.
set design and props are also spectacular.
the underwater lab named mana one is very futuristic and looks very cool.
the abyss gliders are also awesome.
think of a space ship from star wars crossed with a stingray.harry gregson-williams's score was good in all the right places.
sometimes uplifting other times downright thrilling.
that's perhaps the biggest compliment i can give the meg.
it is truly thrilling. i was lucky enough to watch the movie in 4dx. the motion seats made me believe i was on the ocean. the water spray, wind and scent teleported me into the movie.
with every violent action on screen my chair would spasm and shake adding a whole new level of immersion.
i urge you to see the meg in 3d 4dx. with the added dimension and the 4dx you will start to think you're going to get eaten.all in all the meg was excellent and i sat through the entire movie with a huge childlike grin on my face. really i don't understand the negative reviews.
sure the meg is silly and riddled with scientific inaccuracies but surely you must be obviously aware of this before sitting down to watch.jaws may still be the daddy of all shark movies but the meg is definitely the daddy of all sharks (sorry mother of all sharks).
if you want to have fun at the cinema this for me is definitely the highlight of the summer and i hope it makes a squillion dollars!
that way we may get to see the meg chow down some more."

","the meg (2018) *** (out of 4)normally i start off my reviews with a description of the plot but is that really needed for a movie like the meg? okay, a brief one. jason statham battles a prehistoric shark that is destroying everything in its path.the meg was released to a bit of controversy as a lot of people were upset that the studio decided to go for a pg-13 rating instead of a violent and gory r rating. with nearly $150-million on the line i can see why warner would be nervous about releasing a r rated movie but at the same time i don't think movies can be judged on what they are rated. the meg isn't gory or ultra-violent so if that's what you're wanting then it's best to go somewhere else. if you just want a fun popcorn flick then the movie delivers.there's actually a bit more plot here than i'm giving the film credit for but there's no question the main goal was to see stratham in a variety of scenes where he must go up against the shark. for the most part i thought the film worked well, although there were certainly some flaws with the picture including it not seeming to know what it wanted to be. the early scenes are rather dark and it seems as if the director wanted to build up tension. then the film starts to add more laughs and one-liners and there's no doubt that the tone changes. i think one or the other would have been a lot better.with that being said, i think the meg delivers what you would expect it to and that's a lot of fun action scenes with the giant shark doing massive damage to things while the humans must find a way to stop it. there were several good scenes in the picture including an early rescue mission where three people are trapped on the ocean floor. i also thought the ending was quite good and there's no doubt that the action scenes were well-staged and fun.stratham delivers what you would expect out of him. hey, he's not marlon brando but he's not hired to do that kind of acting. i thought he was fun in the role and there's no question that he made it somewhat plausible that his character would be willing to battle this shark. bingbing li was good as well as rainn wilson, page kennedy and cliff curtis. the score was also nicely done and there's no doubt that the cinematography was top-notch.having said that, i do wish there had been a bit more shark action. the shark looked extremely good and this is coming from someone who really isn't a fan of cgi. the effects were extremely good but i just wish we had gotten to see more of them."

","the shark movie has been an ongoing trend for the best part of 48 years, since the release of jaws in 1975, it's been mixed results, from reasonable romps like deep blue sea, the shallows and 47 meters down, to awful absurdities like the jaws sequels, and the sharknado and mega shark series. well, here came another b-movie featuring a shark to sink our teeth into, i debated whether to see it or not, but i took the plunge and had a ""chomp on this"", directed by jon turteltaub (cool runnings, while you were sleeping, national treasure). basically, rescue diver jonas taylor (jason statham) attempts to save a group of scientists in a damaged nuclear submarine, but an unseen force damages the hull, he is unable to rescue a last survivor, at risk of killing everyone else, dr. heller (robert taylor) dismisses his story that a giant sea creature caused the disaster. five years later, billionaire jack morris (rainn wilson) meets dr. minway zhang (winston chao) at an underwater research facility called mana one to oversee an exploration mission. the mission is to explore what may be an even deeper section of the mariana trench concealed by a cloud of hydrogen sulfide, forming a thermocline. the mission is being conducted by lori (jessica mcnamee), taylor's ex-wife, and scientists toshi (heroes' masi oka) and ""the wall"" (trapped star √≥lafur darri √≥lafsson) in a submersible, it appears to be going well, until an unknown sea creature collides, causing the craft to crash and lose communication. station crew member james ""mac"" mackreides (cliff curtis) suggests sending taylor down to attempt a rescue, citing the similarity of this to his story. despite heller's objections, zhang and mac decide to travel to thailand and recruit taylor, while dr. zhang's daughter suyin (bingbing li) attempts the rescue herself, taking another submersible and diving beneath the thermocline. suyin's sub is caught by a gigantic squid, but it is taken off and eaten by the large creature, revealed to be a giant shark. before the shark can return and attack suyin, taylor reaches her and the other sub, distracting the creature with flares. suyin is ordered to return to mana one, while taylor reaches the damaged submersible, he saves lori and the wall, but the shark returns, toshi sacrifices himself, closing the hatch door and diverting the attention of the shark. back at the facility, the scientists determine that the shark is a megalodon, a prehistoric shark, the largest known to mankind, thought to be extinct for millions of years. they then realise that the shark has escaped from the depths of the trench by swimming through a hole in the thermocline, breached by the submersible. the team work together to track and poison the megalodon, or the meg, with a large dose of etorphine, only to realise there is a second much larger megalodon that emerges and attacks, killing the wall, heller, and zhang. that night, morris attempts to destroy the megalodon himself, ordering a helicopter crew to drop charges on it, but he discovers the remains are that of a large whale, he ends up falling overboard into the water, and is killed by the shark. taylor and the remaining mana one crew resolve to track and kill the shark, realising it is en route to a crowded beach on the sanya bay in the chinese mainland. the meg kills several beachgoers, before the mana one crew divert the shark's attention away from the crowd, using the loud audio of whale calls. attempts to fire torpedoes at the meg fail, taylor and suyin are chased around the sanya bay, until taylor manages to cut the megalodon's belly with his damaged sub and stabs it in the eye. other smaller sharks devour the meg, finally killing it, taylor and the others rejoice, he and suyin consider taking a vacation. also starring shuya sophia cai as meiying, ruby rose as jaxx and page kennedy as dj. statham does his predictable tough-guy fine, the supporting cast are all fine as well, this is nothing we haven't seen before, a giant shark causing chaos in the oceans and near beaches, it just means more advanced special effects to bring it all to life, blood and guts, and some cheesy dialogue, not much bite, just simple popcorn-fodder, a silly but sort of fun science-fiction thriller. okay!"

story is predictable even to a child, actors are far from convincing and acting is pretty flat, no developed characters but obviously spectacular cgi for a $150 million budget movie. 
there are lots of things i didn't get though. that whatever-called company invests billions of dollars to search what's underneath the mariana trench, they find a prehistoric fish undiscovered by humans for some million of years, they wake up the fish and then kill it. but why? statham's character feels almost like a superhero as he stabs the meg in the eye with a tiny harpoon and scratches its belly with that glass-toy submersible. well, hard to believe. 
the pressure down there at more than 11.000m underwater is life-supporting lots of tiny colored fish and coral and whatsoever joyful marine life. well again, cousteau and cameron and many other scientists would have had a different opinion. anyway, when i left the cinema i had the feeling i just saw another weak summer ""blockbuster"" made only for the sake of the box-office and the profit. 5/10 from me. disappointing."

","we'll definitely need a bigger boat, oh wait, wrong movie...right, well lets just be blunt about this, you know exactly what you are getting yourself into here when you venture in to watch a movie such as ""the meg"". but still, it was something that called out to me and made me venture to the cinema to watch it.first of all, it is a shark movie. and i am a sucker for creature features, and i have always enjoyed shark movies ever since ""jaws"". but unfortunately the genre is flooded with subpar movies that do sharks no justice with horrible cgi or multiple heads, swimming in sand, and what not... but it turned out that ""the meg"" was going to correct all that and put the genre back on track.secondly, it has jason statham in it. so you know that you will be in for an action-packed movie. and yes, he delivered as usual. in fact, this might as well have been a movie that had dwayne johnson in the lead, and it would still have been an enjoyable movie.while ""the meg"" does follow that generic and straight forward formula of 'how-to-make-a-shark-movie' then it was still an enjoyable movie experience; one that was packed with action, suspense and a pinch of drama. the movie starts out slow and fairly steadily, and of course you don't get to see the shark right away, because suspense had to be built up. but we all knew it was coming, so why prolong the suspense by throwing another aquatic creature in the audience's faces?this is the type of movie that you exactly how it will end. and it was that predictable, yes. but again, that was not a factor that weighed the movie down or worked against in any fashion. because the movie was entertaining from start to end.i will say that jason statham was actually quite nice in the movie, because he fit the role of the jonas taylor character quite well. and i was also quite impressed with the performances of bingbing li (playing suyin), cliff curtis (playing mac) and winston chao (playing zhang).the special effects were incredible, as they should be in a movie such as this. and this is where 90% of the movies in the monstrous killer shark movie fail, by having laughable special effects that wouldn't even fool a blind man. the sharks looked realistic and real, not to mention menacing.i do feel that the beach scene was horribly shortened and made almost family friendly. that whole thing with the heroes managing to lure the megalodon away from the meal that was lined right up in the nick of time was just lazy writing. i felt so cheated out of a scene that would have and should have turned into a feeding frenzy and massacre of beach-goers. but hey, a matter of how morbid you are, i suppose...all in all a very enjoyable shark movie, and one that definitely takes the sinking shark genre and brings it back to the surface. i definitely think that your money, time and efforts will be well spent on taking the time to watch ""the meg""."

","ignore the bad reviews this film is awesome, based on the books by steve alten jason statham plays jonas taylor perfect with a fearless attuide and a total badass taking on the biggest predator to roam the oceans for over 65 million years.the special effect for the megalodon are perfectly done showing a species that has been living for a long time in the depth of the ocean, also showing just how meancing and dangerous these things truly are. the meg is a perfect example of what would happen if a megalodon was still alive today in our time. throughout most of the movie, the film is extremly intense from start to finish special the scene when chaos ensues as the megalodon attacks.rainn wilson feels like he trying to be the comic relief of the film, which some of the jokes or one-liner did kind of fall flat at times but a really good performance as the millionaire that owns the research base. page kennedy was pretty funny at times throughout the movie, great performance, ruby rose as well great performance, masi oka more of a cameo as he role in the film is pretty short but with his character he a brave man.pretty much all-round performance from everyone, including bingbing li who looks absolutely gorgeous in this film, playing a marine biologist and shark expert who held her own through this film, also with the child star shuya sophia cai playing suyin (bingbing li) daughter, who performance through the film was just incredible with a cuteness level that makes you laugh at certain scenes.the visual effect is amazing showing the intense scene that keeps the audience of the edge of there seat, as there are moments that this movie pushed that 12a to the limit, it the perfect balance of comedy and scares throughout the whole movie.what great is the fact the second half of the film doesn't base itself of the human side of things with the character which is great, because it doesn't just feel like it a statham film. the first half the film focus on character development which a establish the main character as the story progress, in the second have the blend balance from a focus on character become the team focus on taking down the shark.this is great because it's, not your typical film that focuses on the character through the film, it does focus on the megalodon, which gives this film its edge. another thing i noticed which is attention to detail is the shark behaviour which they got perfect in this film, as you notice with a great white documentary you notice that great white will come close to check you out, they suddenly disappear into the darkness. what you not aware of is their sneak attack to catch you off guard, this was put perfectly in the megalodon behaviour as a shark in this film. science in marine biology is perfectly used as well to make it more believable, which works for the story plot as well. there were a few jaws references and one finding nemo reference which was kind of amusing in a intense scene, the pace is perfect for this type of movie.after watching this film, it should get a sequel, personally, they should do a jaws reboot because this film shows a perfect base to lead from, in showing just how amazing this film truly is.this is a film i highly recommended watching on the big screen, as it a must seen, great casting, great performance and one hell of an intense ride through the whole film.

"111","the meg 2","ionicbreezemachine",2023-08-03,7," after 20 years of development hell, the meg faces off against jason statham in this playfully fun shark film
","at the mana one research facility off the coast of china, dr. zhang (winston chao) along with his daughter suyin (li bingbing) are researching the mariana trench with their research being financed by jack morris (rainn wilson). when an exploratory dive lead by lori taylor (jessica mcnamee) discovers a deeper section of the trench, the lori and the crew end up stranded when something attacks their sub. with time running out dr. zhang and mac (cliff curtis) go to thailand and bring in former rescue diver and lori's ex-husband jonas taylor (jason statham) who quit following a tragedy on a nuclear submarine where he claimed something attacked it but was met with disbelief. jonas reluctantly takes up the assignment and it isn't long before jonas' story is confirmed to be true and an ancient predator known as the megalodon or meg is unleashed upon the world.the meg is the long in development adaptation of steve alten's 1997 novel meg: a novel of deep terror. the meg is notable for its lengthy development cycle that began in 1996 before the book was even published and went through a rotation of different studios and production teams. initially started at disney's hollywood pictures label, development stalled on the film following the underperformance of deep rising as well as warner bros.' own shark film deep blue sea beating meg to development with the rights reverting back to alten. using the internet to keep meg in the presence of fans' minds, none other than guillermo del toro was able to set up the film at new line cinema with jan de bont slated to direct only for new line to get nervous about the $100 million budget and once again development stalled. the film finally gain traction in 2015 as an international co-production between warner bros. and chinese based company gravity pictures and following a minor hiccup with eli roth being replaced with jon turteltaub, the film became a sleeper hit overindexing in the united states and making over $500 million worldwide. much like the novel it's based on, the meg doesn't have any higher aspirations than taking a giant prehistoric shark and letting it run rampant and for my money it doesn't do it half-bad.what makes the meg work so well in my opinion is in its fairly light tone and a solid cast of likable characters. jason statham although a departure from taylor's depiction in the book makes the role his own and really showcases that cocky, arrogant, smartass side of himself that he's put to such good use in things like his collaborations with guy ritchie that first gained him recognition. we also have some solid performers making up the rest of the cast such as robert taylor, rainn wilson, cliff curtis, and ruby rose and while they're playing pretty standard characters for this kind of big summer monster movie, they're allowed to give more presence and likability to their performances and characters in comparison to other similar films (such as jurassic world: fallen kingdom which came out that same year but was way less fun). we also get some fun work from li binging as suyin and sophia cai as meiying zhang with some genuinely amusing moments between them and statham's character. in terms of effects work the movie just looks beautiful. the mana one research station looks high tech with lots of bright colors that really pop and even the underwater photography is put to good use with some clear visuals (both in the cgi heavy sub sequences and lower tech sequences) and the filmmakers create some really fun setpieces using the meg and the actors. it also helps that there's no really unlikable characters in the film and you actually care about whether they live or die. the one disappointment is that while there is plenty of bloody shark fun to be had, because of the pg-13 rating a major sequence set in sanya bay feels way cleaner than it should be and the meg feels like it's a bit too restrained during that scene. luckily despite that one disappointing aspect, the rest of the movie delivers including an entertainingly over the top climax.the meg is a simple movie with a simple promise: jason statham versus a giant shark. the meg delivers on all the fronts it plays on and serves as fun escapist entertainment that isn't afraid to be anymore than it is. while i'm sure many of us wish this had gone as far as that piranha remake in terms of feeding frenzies, there was virtually no chance that would happen and this was the best we could've hoped for."

""jaws"" is outright terrifying. ""the meg"" exactly 180 degree away from that. why the cgi pictures at times are impressive, you never feel scared or worried, because the megalodon is never believable in the first place (75 ft, meaning 3 to 4 times the size of the great white in ""jaws""). in other words, this is ""jaws on steroids"", but without the thrills. i have to say, i was really disappointed with this movie.""the meg"" opened wide this past weekend and vastly over-performed at the box office ($45 mill, instead of the projected $25 mill). it will be interesting to see how it does next weekend, now that the word is out that this is a so-so movie. the (discount) tuesday evening screening where i saw this at here in cincinnati was attended okay but not great. if you are in the mood for a shark movie and can keep your expectations low, i encourage you to check this out, be it in the theater, on vod, or eventually on dvd/blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."

","the meg is a somewhat entertaining homage to old-era shark flicks. a frightful direction and vibrant special effects provide a serviceable summer-end movie. fans of shark flicks may want to check it out.the movie follows a shanghai-based, deep-sea team as they seek to postulate new discoveries among the underwater trenches. however, their discoveries go awry when a previously thought extinct megalodon attacks their submersibles and threatens to roam the shanghai seas. with time on the run, team leader dr. zhao (winston chao) recruits former rescue diver jonas (jason statham). unbeknownst to everyone, jonas has previously encountered the same megalodon and must now confront his fears to save those aboard.jason statham, as jonas, is always a vibrant presence with his charm and smarm making gold of the cheesy script. he also excels in his underwater stunts, creating some nail-biting thrills. bingbing li, as suyin, proves herself as a smart, yet impatient presence, who wants to prove herself. however, she does fall key to an unnecessary clich√©d father-daughter subplot, but makes the best of what she is given. winston chao, as dr. zhang, greatly presents his fears and desperation for suyin and the mission, in spite of the weak backing for the emotional stakes of the two. rainn wilson, as jacks, heightens his stereotypical rich guy presence with well-timed remarks alike his in the office. shuya sophia cai, as meiyang, is my favorite character in her banter with statham and brave actions power her from just being a 8-year-old damsel in distress. she truly excels in her first, breakout role. ruby rose, page kennedy, and cliff curtis complete the rest of the pack, each giving a unique performance, even if the characters can be viewed as expendable at times.jon turteltaub's direction allows for brisk thrills taking inspiration from jaws, but allowing for his own unique takes on the genre. my favorite scene is the final act, as it goes all in with the illogic of the shark conflicts allowing for a fun conclusion. the other flaws are the inconsistency of the tone and writing of the movie, which goes from serious to knowingly funny at times and the placement of the scenes feels off at times. the movie also suffers by detracting from the shark conflict and focusing on poorly written character situations. in fact, it takes a long amount of occasionally grueling time and development for the megalodon to even show up.the movie's message is that being a hero can come with its fair share of compromises. i give this film 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, because of intense action, gore and some language.reviewed by arjun n., kids first! film critic. for more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org."

","the meg is the embodiment of everything wrong with the average shark flick, and yet it manages to sink lower than the bottom of the deepest, bluest sea. horrible one-dimensional characters, unimaginative cinematography, and a story so surface level it's an insult to the ground floor are only a few of the problems this bottom-feeding film has. this film is incredibly lazy and relies entirely on special effects to carry its paper-thin plot and horrifically uninteresting characters through a mind-numbing two hours.one fundamental flaw that one will notice immediately is the tone, as it's nothing like the trailer advertises. the trailer makes the film seem a lot more wink-wink than it actually is, but there's hardly an ounce of fun to be had in the film aside from a stupid gag with a dog, akin to a certain laughable scene from independence day. most of the film is played straight for the most part, and it's not nearly as over-the-top as a shark movie needs to be nowadays. i mean seriously, you either have to go big or go home, so either go the stupid schlockfest route like sharknado, or go for more of a serious jaws approach. the movie is somewhere in the middle and rather than feeling unique it feels like an ungodly chimera that needs to be taken out of its misery. there are many scenes that drag on far too long with people talking and nothing really happening, and since the movie isn't very serious there is never any suspense throughout it.there's also the issue of the violence being toned down by the studio. jon turteltaub apparently had to cut many gory moments out of the movie to secure a pg-13 rating for marketing purposes, to which even he was disappointed. what results is a very mild-mannered shark flick that constantly feels like it pulls its punches. though i'm sure this film toed the lines of the pg-13 rating, it doesn't feel like it, as there's not much to be invested in and the result is low-impact violence that isn't worth its weight in beans.there's a bunch of characters in the movie and none of them have any depth besides trying to be a certain basic template for just about anyone to relate to. the diversity hire aspect is also apparent to an excessive extent here, with some hilariously ironic stereotyping to boot, such as nerdy asians and a black man who can't swim. there's a clear goal here of getting into china's wallets with some mild marketing to less-profitable minority groups that's only thinly veiled by dumb, likely polarizing humor, given how easily offended radical liberals, i.e. the target demographic, tend to be at immature humor nowadays.i felt the sound design was awful. i was bored out of my mind during what was intended to be the thrilling climax of the film, and it instead felt like a coldplay music video. the music was not suspenseful or memorable, and dipped between the grating noise and soothing ambience on a whim with a motley crew of instruments all tossed together in a quantity over quality sort of fashion. there are moments in which the music sounds fine, and other moments in which it sounds completely lacking in confidence and desperate to be more grandiose than it truly is. the score wasn't even the problem though, as i found myself crippled with the cringe of the movie being book-ended with a thai version of ""hey mickey"" just out of nowhere. it left me with an empty feeling inside, of which i would need weeks of counseling to reverse. the applause from the audience rang out like explosions in my brain, leaving me scared and disoriented. the cgi blood on the screen gave me a temporary case of ptsd.the name is also incredibly stupid. i get that the book is called 'meg,' but that's even worse. the meg that immediately comes to just about anyone's mind is meg griffin from family guy, and i don't think i need to explain further why that's an issue. megalodon is also an incredible title, and is in fact what mastodon used as a song title one time, and it didn't make people cringe, so that's probably a better route to take.the meg isn't stupid enough to be entertaining, nor is it self-aware enough to be charming, and it most certainly isn't shot well enough to be exciting. this is a terrible shark film, and it's not like i'm too harsh on the genre either. i'd recommend deep blue sea and sharknado for dumb fun, and jaws for a more serious horror film. this movie is basically all the worst elements of the countless shark films that came before it. it barely attempts to cover up its flaws, and as a result just feels like a clear bait-and-switch meant to keep audiences in their seats long enough that they can't get a refund."

","you have to take in to context the post release statements by director jon turteltaub and lead actor jason statham. the meg is not the film they either read on the page or filmed as a course of grisly schlock entertainment. this was meant to be a proper schlocker, a bloodletting monster of the deep on the loose picture, sadly the suits at the helm didn't see that as a viable money making exercise and had this cut to be a ""12"" friendly bums on theatre seats cash grabber. shame on them.what we get is a run of the mill creature feature that although once viewed does not leave a lasting impression (was anyone really hoping for that anyway?), but is kind of fun in that time filling sort of way. it runs through the modern day creature feature playbook 101. so off we go with the hero having a troubled backstory, a money made funder out of his depth, ladies with life quandaries, a man who can't swim working in the middle of the ocean! and on we go. throw in some quite awfully scripted dialogue and it's cheese sarnie time.statham is nearly always a good watch - in the muscle bound action hero kind of way - though you see the cracks between what the film was meant to be and what it ended up as. for you see that the stath comes off as taking it all too seriously, which in this released cut is ridiculous. he's surrounded by no mark actors, though no short supply of beauty (bingbing li socko gorgeous/ruby rose hard sexy) and the narrative feeds us all the pointers of exactly where this will end up. there's a couple of nifty fun homages to jaws, some decent suspense scenes, and the cinematography (tom stern) is pin sharp and pleasurable.best bet to enjoy this is to know it's a ""12"" rated friendly piece, to understand it has ultimately ended up as a same old same old monster movie. it's a million miles away from the class of jaws, and lacks the tongue in cheek knowing of deep blue sea, but it fills a gap in that undemanding time wasting way. 5/10"

"137","the meg 2","curiositykilledshawn",2018-08-20,3," nothing like the novel
","and the award for biggest disappointment of the decade goes to...after 21 years in development hell this drivel is the best that they could manage? really? i realize that it is hard to make a serious shark movie in a sub-genre now contaminated by spoofs and mockbusters but even jaws 3 is better than this. statham vs shark could have been an entertaining movie, instead it's an extremely boring one.jason statham is jonas taylor (this character name and the nature of the beast are the only things retained from the novel, i am not kidding) a diving/underwater guy (his exact occupation is never disclosed, but in the novel he's a palaeontologist and a marine biologist) who encounters a big shark one day and no one believes him. flash-forward a while and said shark attacks a craft exploring the bottom of the ocean in the mariana trench. when he turns up to rescue them the shark is set free from the extreme cold that has kept it confined to the lower depths.the scene is set for an enormous shark to go on a bloody rampage...which never happens. those teases you fell for in the trailer...a product of careful editing. the meg doesn't have the balls, or the teeth, to be a horror film. all it is capable of is low-brow schlock, and you don't need a $100 million budget for that when the mockbusters and rip-offs do it just as well.the story relocates from america to china because the studio wanted to cash-in on the chinese market (or because megs like chinese food), the deaths are bloodless and telegraphed, and every time the writers need a moment of tension or excitement they have a character fall overboard. no joke, if you were to play a drinking game for every time someone fell into the water you'd be dead of alcohol poisoning long before the credits role. the cinematography is awful too, coloring the movie in nothing but greys and blues, resulting in a very bland visual experience. i also have to call out the dialogue as being particularly bad, especially the character of zhang, who attempts to deliver meaningful soliloquies on a couple of occasions which just come across as laughable and totally out of place.if the studio are looking forward to developing this into a franchise then they have painted themselves into corner by deviating from the source material so much. any sequels may retain the title of the novels but they too will have to be completely different in the same way that those awful resident evil movies were nothing like the games that inspired them.jaws it ain't. it's not even up to the standards of deep blue sea."

this is a routine creature feature with a big budget for special effects. it provides fair entertainment but has a b movie feel with not enough thrills to justify its running time. it is let down by a poor script and risible dialogue."

"140","the meg 2","kristamw",2018-08-11,10," the meg is awesome
","steve alten's story is incredibly displayed on the screen! a lover of the jaws franchise, i immensely enjoyed this action-packed thriller. jon turteltaub's work is right up there with spielberg's in the way of three important elements:
 
1. excitement
2. nervous tension
3. humor
 
three research scientists are stranded in a submarine in the deep--below 11 meters. jason statham (jonas) is approached for his expertise in rescue missions, and because he is only one in three who have attempted and survived one at that depth; five years earlier, jonas saved all but one passenger on his ship in a similar situation. now, jonas is busy living and drinking the life in thailand, and living with survivor's guilt, so he is reluctant to have any part of this assignment.
 
until he learns that this mission involves his ex-wife. until he hears the cries of the three scientists.
 
the meg doesn't hesitate to propel us into action sequences right from the start. the rush of adventure is high and heart-stomping. one of my favorite scenes is the moment we get our first close-up of the prehistoric shark. little girl meiying ( sophia cai ) is playing in the underground facility when the shark pulls itself all the way up to the glass--you get a full picture of its face, and the magnitude of it is captivating!
 
there are plenty of moments with the meg, something i appreciate, both up close moments--you know, the expected jump scares--as well as distant shots of its fin fishtailing (yes, i said it) through the ocean in swiftly nearing proximity to a large cast of characters.
 
to offset some of the intense moments, we get wordplay between several of the characters, creating fun endearing moments that build on the dynamics of multiple relationships.
 
bonus: meiying is super precious and wonderful to watch in her interactions with her mom and jonas, eliciting lots of smiles and tender laughter."

","what i liked the most about the meg (2018), was its goal to stay out of sharknado (a made-for-tv film from 2013), territory and try to teeter closer to jaws (1975), territory. for this review, i rewatched it again on a streaming service, but i did see it, during its initial run in the the theaters in 2018. this film has the right amount of comedy, mixed in with the terror-side of the story. raine wilson steals the show with the comedy lines. the meg (2018), is nowhere near the silly-level of sharknado. i'm not the biggest jason statham fan, but i like him in this film. it's also nice seeing masi oka back in something. he played hiro nakamura on the cult, hit tv show, heroes (2006-2010). one time batwoman, ruby rose, has a role in the film and very talented, cliff curtis, rounds out a pretty good cast. i do like bingbing li's performance as suyin in this too.the plot is pretty basic and easy to follow, which helps you set aside, that aspect of the film and enjoy the crazy visuals on the screen. a volcano, has created a warm sea on the bottom of the ocean. a prehistoric megalodon, which evolved on the bottom of the ocean, for millions of years, in the warm sea, escapes its frigid, undersea barrier, when the volcano explodes and creates a path to the surface. this is where man meets megalodon. jason statham's disgraced jonas taylor, has to return to the job, that sent him away, when he has to rescue a submarine crew from the giant shark. after that, it's a fight for survival. there is plenty of backstory for the main characters, that keep the human part of the story going and the interactions between the characters in the plot, makes sense, while all this chaos is happening around them. i mean, come on. it's a movie about a giant shark. a giant, prehistoric shark.considering the underwater technology made up for the film, is an indication, that the story takes place, slightly further into the future. this is another part of the science-fiction angle of the plot. because of the very nature of the subject matter in this film, even with its 175 million dollar budget, it still gets automatically roped into the world of the b-movie film. for the exception of jaws (1975), shark movies, these days, immediately get tagged this way. but, like the spaghetti westerns of the 1960s, maybe it will become a badge of honor someday. in the world of cult classics. there are many films appreciated more today, then they were at the time of their initial theatrical release. this film was very profitable, but was split on the critical side. that means people still went to see it, just for the mere spectacle of it all. it could achieve cult status someday.7.3 c+ mygrade) = 7 imdb."

","the meg is a b grade action horror film with a grade effects and an amazing ensemble, and though it only borrows loosely from its source material, it still makes for a thoroughly enjoyable experience. jonas taylor (the seemingly indestructible jason statham), is a former deep-sea diving expert, though his past, which was explored in depth during the novel, is only briefly alluded to for the sake of storytelling. when a submersible is lost in an unexplored region of the ocean, taylor is the one man, according to his friend, mac (cliff curtis), to bring the crew, including taylor's ex-wife, lori (jessica mcnamee), back safely, though you would be forgiven for having no idea they'd been married. mac's plan however receives strong criticism from doctor heller (robert taylor), and suyin (the beautifully ageless li bingbing).suyin's father, zhang (winston chao), the man behind the operation, has much interest in the ocean, though the reasons for this are only marginally explored. moreover, though steve alten, in his novel, described a massive prehistoric world, what we do see in the film seems disappointingly small, despite being unbelievably gorgeous. miss li brings a lot of passion and conviction to her character, the confident yet vulnerable suyin, her emotional range making for some touching scenes. her daughter, meiying (sophia cai), is equally sweet, though their relationship deserved more screen time. the always amazing mr curtis on the other hand is occasionally forgotten, and there are moments when he isn't seen at all. other characters, including tycoon morris (rainn wilson) is the stereotypical arrogant millionaire, with a total disregard for human decency, while jaxx (ruby rose) is the largely forgettable designer of the station, whose role needed a lot more fleshing out. it is dj (page kennedy) however, who has the most insulting role of all, as the typically hysterical black man. his antics, not to mention the innuendo and crude gags that accompany a lot of the script, are meant to offer comic relief, though for the most part, is unbelievable and unnecessary drivel.of course, the film is not called 'meg' just for the sake of it. it does take some time before we see the great big beast, but it is certainly worth the wait, an unforeseen event (unlike the one in the novel) inadvertently releasing the giant shark into the waters of the twenty first century. trouble naturally ensues, the station the team occupies (which we never do see enough of) coming under attack. despite the title, it would have been so much more engrossing to see more of the tyrannical monster, and though this is a creature feature, the occasional violence is kept to a minimal.despite its predictability and basic narrative (if you've seen shark attack 3: megalodon, this is similar), meg is thoroughly enjoyable, brainless fun. there is a lot that goes unexplained, and you could spend a lot of time poking holes in the plot, that frenetically speeds along. that being said, there are some excellent jump scares, and jason statham has a lot of fun as the stone-faced hero, the end result being a crescendo of excitement and unending suspense.

(jonas? surely some sly joke?). jonas is drinking his life away in thailand after being traumatised by an underwater rescue mission in which he was 90% successful. (yeah, i know.... perfectionists.... hate 'em!). but he is needed again, since his cute ex-wife lori (jessica mcnamee) is stuck at the bottom of the sea being terrorised by a terrifying creature: no, not spongebob square pants... the titular prehistoric shark.lori is working at an undersea research station - mana one - off the coast of china, funded by the annoyingly brash billionaire morris (rainn wilson, from ""the office""), who you just hope hope hope will get munched at some point! running the station (in the most shameless hollywood/chinese market crossover since ""the great wall"") is zhang (winston chao) assisted by his cute daughter suyin (played by the gloriously named and very talented bingbing li) and his even cuter granddaughter meiying (sophia cai). the race is on to use their brains and taylor's brawn to stop the monster from reaching the seaside resort of sanya bay for lunch. the action is, of course, absurd with so many near misses for jonas from gnashing teeth that he could be the meg's registered dentist. there is a really nice dynamic though built up between jonas, his potential cross-cultural love interest suyin and young meiying. suyin is a classic timesup heroine for 2018, with an assertive attitude and not remotely giving an inch to statham's hero.but it's young sophia as meying who really steals lines and steals hearts with a truly charming performance, and would get my 'man of the match' were it not for... research assistant jaxx (australian model, ruby rose). she has an absolutely extraordinary look in this film. chiselled and tattooed, she literally looks like she has stepped out of a final fantasy video game... and acts well too: the complete package.as referenced above, the hollywood/chinese crossover is quite striking in this film, with the chinese beach location looking like amity island on steroids! (cue the overweight chinese kid as the jaws ""alex"" replacement... who knew that they also have 'zoom' ice lollies in china!) unusually for a mainstream western film, a significant number of lines in the film are in chinese with english subtitles.in the league table of shark movies, it is far nearer to ""deep blue sea"" than it is to ""jaws"", the reigning league champion, and all are far in excess of the ridiculous ""sharknado"". but compared to ""deep blue sea"", and even compared to ""jaws"" - now, astonishingly, 43 years old! - it's a curiously bloodless concoction, presumably to guarantee it's 12a certificate. i have seen far bloodier and more violent 12a's, and if anything i think director jon turteltaub (""national treasure"") rather overdid the sanitisation. it's not going to win many gongs at the oscars, but it is a slice of movie fun nonetheless."

","okay, let's say up front that the meg is an incredibly dumb movie. now, you might argue it's more or less jaws with a bigger shark, and you'd be right, but jaws, while not the masterpiece so many say it is, is like tolstoy compared to this. the characters are cardboard and sometimes played by actors who seem to believe that's all that's required of their performance. (to be fair, some of the actors don't seem like english is their first language, so perhaps that's why they are so wooden, but it doesn't excuse the others, like the pinch-faced ruby rose.)but there's so much more. obviously the production design is trying to be on par with jurassic park and similar sfx movies with thin stories but lots of cgi. sometimes it comes close. but all that isn't enough if you don't care about the people and the story is dumb on top of it.case in point, after fighting and seemingly defeating the meg in what are heavily shark infested waters, one of the crew's lunkheaded blue-collar lugs decides to engage in some idiotic grabass that results in a crewmember being tossed overboard and -- no surprise -- eaten. okay, but later when he is enraged and scolding others, there's no self-awareness his part in the disaster, which ultimately leads to the capsizing of the ship and the loss of even more life. instead, all the blame is heaped on the elon musk-type rich guy because, you know, the formula these days says they're always to blame.no, this is just a simple minded adrenaline rush where people yell and scream a lot with absolutely no sense of anything except the moment. in this respect, it's a lot like deep blue sea, another mindless sfx misadventure with sharks. but at least samuel l. jackson had the good sense to get out of that story earlier."

(gumby was a clokey production.)the bleeding edge underwater facilities (financed by the unscrupulous billionaire), are fairly cool and creative.yes, a few scenes are unintentionally comedic, like statham being snatched away by a ship's tow cable, from inside meg's mega snapping jaw, just making it by a split second. but that's ok too.speaking of statham, he is 100% stathamesque as you'd expect, so that's worth the price of admission by itself. but deficiencies aside; this movie has plenty of decent thrills and fast action.look! it's a ""b"" scifi- drama movie. the mediocre script is predictable and the players are just ok. still, as mentioned above, it moves well. add in a few 'spooky' parts as well. as an example, the scene where the little girl is playing by herself in a section of the impervious underwater station/lab, is pretty creepy.the guy who spent billions to finance this entire underwater marvel is richard cranium. his friends call him dick head for short. he's both goofy and obnoxious (mostly the latter), & as you might expect, gets more than he bargained for.i gave it a 7 and that's fair, and moreover, compared to the imdb ratings of many other similarly produced movies, probably empirically factual that it belongs in the range of 6-8. i later raised it to an 8 just because it's a fun action scifi that keeps one's attention better than 90% of the tripe the studios are (and have been) regurgitating for so long now.definitely worth the watch, that's for sure. yes, a bit hokey at times, but so what.okay, that's it. take it in and you be the judge.thxbob r."

","ah dear me jason jason, you have to feel sorry for him he tried to make an effort to save this movie but knew the movie would drown. let's be honest people, the meg is a terrible film.
yes there's the creepy scare factor and it's tense, yes cgi did a great job at making things look real and also the meg shark was a more interesting shark than jaws, but apart from that this movie is lame, implausible, cheesy and dumb.
the inclusion of inappropriate humour, characters you want to choke to death, daft dialogue and an illogical first act, this movie unsurprisingly scored more sins than other movies of this type.
i am sure the creators spent more time on the special effects than developing then script and organising the plot. the problem was the use of humour didn't work it just took away any built up tension and engagement. i have to add the opening twenty minutes is visually good with the innovative tech and crew, the budget they had on full display, but with terrible editing and cutting. there wasn't much on the background of the characters other than statham and the use the researchers barely knew much also didn't send for any help. this really sucked and the whole plot at defeating a shark, with a lack of development and research, really sucked also.
some of the acting in this is 1/10. i think the chinese, new zealanders or whoever messed up this entire movie especially the beach scene where they're all floating in the water with rings like it's compulsory and then told it's safe after thirty people have got eaten, just woeful and succeeds in taking the realism and genuine efforts away from the film.
when your making a film like this with this kind of budget everyone should have been including jason way more committed. this should done way better not rushed just carefully planned. it's not all about what pleases your eyes. not when how sexy jason is or they hot girl with the tattoos. what gets in the way of the film being enjoyable and entertaining is not that it's going to be compared to other films of the same genre, but how all of the above from the dialogue to the ridiculousness."

1.cgi was used to often and as expected, was off. in one scene the mouth is big enough to take down a whale, in another scene the mouth was not too much bigger than jaws(which was 25ft not 75ft like meg). in some scenes the cgi was just a par above sharknado. deep blue or shallow water did much much better effects with a portion of the budget. it is sad that a movie made 43 years ago has a more realistic shark.2. acting, statham plays the exact same role and emotions whether it is transporter, crank or two stocked barrels. you get what you get. bingbing li went to kristen stewart/kneau reaves school of acting, had the same face at beginning of movie, when she is talking technical jargon or when daughter in danger or almost dying....no change or ability to show emotions. 3. director: i will avoid this director. when people have someone close to them killed by a prehistoric shark, they do not make stupid one-liners two scenes later which actually is only an hour after the death. just because it was probably two weeks between the scenes in filming, director and actors have to remember that someone just died and i should be showing anger or sadness not making a one-liner about someone's hair. next point, no one ever really seemed scared regardless of situation.4. writing: a shark taking down 50ft whales and yachts would not notice, care, or see a human. no one reports or posts on social media that they saw a prehistoric shark? no one calls for backup? no one says 'let's get off the water? how do people mostly with phd's not know basics of science? writing/screenplay just all over the place.in end, i watched a big-budget sharknado."

","jason statham, arguably a worthy successor of daniel craig as the next james bond, has taken an odd misstep in ""the meg"". i can only assume there were many, many zeroes more than ""007"" involved in influencing his decision to take a role in this picture. a deep-sea submersible is under threat by a massive megaladon shark, long thought to be extinct, now lies at the bottom of the deepest trench in the pacific with its crew trapped inside. with time running out, jonas taylor (jason statham) is recruited to save the crew. as the movie progresses, we find out that taylor had encountered the shark long before and is a practitioner of the long lost art of shark punching. i wanted to like jon turteltaub's movie but the meg is bad, but only rarely in the fun way. maybe it would be better if they went full camp, as in the sharknado franchise?statham seems itching for some of his usual classic james bond-style british ass-kickery for which he is known, most of which is not on display. 
rainn wilson plays shifty billionaire who's financed a deep-sea exploration project. this is a chinese production, taking place off the coast of shanghai. chinese star li bingbing has been enlisted to support statham, her charismatic quality shining through a roughed-in character.the most important cast member, though, is of course the titular massive meg, a cgi creation who appears early and often.there are a few chuckle-worthy sight gags and the third act climax, involving a bunch of panicked beachgoers, which evokes jaws in a knowing tribute, provides some legitimate thrills. shark fans are likely to be interested, but be warned: it's clumsy and slow and lacks genuine scares."

","while this film is very enjoyable; unfortunately, the meg (2018) is a throwaway summer blockbuster and mediocre at best. the film's lack of character development, along with less than stellar performances by the majority of the cast, ultimately hindered my ability to feel any remorse or sympathy for certain characters, nor did i develop any emotional connection with characters. not all is grim; luckily, the film's lead, jason statham, delivered a very pleasant performance. statham carried the film from the opening scene, all the way through until the end credits. statham was a charismatic badass and stole every scene in which he was physically present, and without him, the film would have failed. and besides shuya sophia cai's adorable meiying, this is where the praise for performances end. li bingbing's addition was an obvious attempt to appeal to the foreign audience, and the rest of the supporting cast gave forgettable performances. it was plainly obvious certain characters were written for the sole purpose of having an action scene transpire by making costly decisions or for plot convenience. from a technical standpoint, the meg (2018) was a fest for the eyes; the cgi and special effects were very crisp and believable, except for a shot near the end of the film involving the meg itself and statum. the sound design was great, as it really brought the extinct titanic meg to life. the final positive of the film was it's consistent pacing; there were small amounts of the extended expedition, which ultimatly hurt the film's character development, and plenty of intense shark action. in conclusion, the meg is nothing more of a shallow plot strung together with cool shark action scenes and unnecessary, poorly written characters. i would not recommend this film, especially after considering the fact that other, more enjoyable summer films, such as mission impossible: fallout or even the lighthearted teen titans go to the movies, are other options for a trip to the movies."

","just saw the movie with my 10 year old for a sneak peak and it didn't disappoint. having read the books in 10th grade marine biology 20 years ago, my expectations were guarded as i knew it would stray from the science to focus on the laughs and action, and i had been anticipating a movie more in line with piranha then jaws, but i am pleased to report my daughter and i left with smiles on our faces and anxious to see it again, hopefully in 3d next. it's fast pace storyline makes the two hour run time fly bye, and the movie is one of the few to find the perfect balance between comedy and scares. the latter half of the movie even throws a few jaws references in for good measure appeasing the nostalgic fans. it doesn't waste too much time into delving into silly sub-plots trying to be more than it is with political undertones like the recent jurrasic series have but keeps a dynamic enough cast to appeal to just about anyone. 
 the movie doesnt try to hide what it is, but rather embraces the absurdity of the premise and goes full throttle to becoming the summers most satisfying, if not most surprising, big scale movies in recent memory. lots of toungue in cheek humor for the fan boys and great special effects, only thing id wish they did was not hold back on the gore as much, though considering the nature of the target audience this can be forgiven. hopefully sequels don't follow the overboard campiness of other surprise hits like piranha 3d or settle for low budget fodder like sharknado, the story line leaves a lot of room for exploration of the mythos and source material. meg leaves the audience wanting to chomp back for more, hopefully its not a long wait for the sequel!"

"241","the meg 2","canpatbuck3664",2018-08-11,7," a compentent entry in the genre but the meg needed a sharper edge
","i went to see the meg with a friend more because of how excited he was about it. the marketing for the movie reminded me of deep blue sea and while i do enjoy that movie for its campy glory, i didn't need to see a lesser version in the theatre. but after seeing the first part of the movie, i was surprised that it was put together competently. the first thing that caught my eye was the cgi and that it was consistently good throughout. the movie obviously boasted a big budget and i'm happy to say it was put to good use. the long shots of the open water, the plant life, the underwater research station and the environment were all passable and i didn't see anything that was less than impressive.i'll have some further comments about the nature of the action later but what they decided to include in the movie also did the trick. the sharks are animated appropriately, and they are at least threatening throughout the run time. it helps that you have an experienced action movie star like jason statham in the lead to add a little bit of credibility at the forefront, but i think the meg cleared the bar they set for themselves. the movie definitely makes you nervous but they balance it with a few well-placed moments of levity. i'm going to also add a small disclaimer for safety, if you need complete realism from your action, this is not one of those movies so take heed of that going into the theatre.what i have to say about the cast is a bit of a mixed bag. jason statham was the right guy to lead this movie. jonas taylor is a very statham character and jason is one of the best in the business at this type of movie (action/thriller that borders being campy). jason's guilty of coasting a bit on his natural charisma, but he's a more than capable lead for the meg. bingbing li is decent as suyin, her dialogue is a little forced with her accent and her part seesaws into being cliche but she does what she can with what she's given. i also thought they made a good choice deciding to cast rainn wilson as morris, he would be an all too easy to peg character if they had gone with more traditional casting. but he shines through with his ability to be funny and at least brings in some doubt to who morris is with his performance. they brought in some recognizable actors to fill in the supporting cast including: cliff curtis, ruby rose, masi oka and page kennedy. there isn't a bad performance among them, but they also aren't given much screen time. i would describe them as suffering from their characters being underdeveloped. i also like robert taylor normally, but his character was so annoying that i couldn't enjoy his acting choices.the trailer for the meg advertised a movie that could have been the right kind of crazy. while the movie isn't devoid of tension and there are moments where you're afraid for the characters, this movie was too content to play in the shallow end instead of venturing out into deeper into the violent nature of the premise. i understand the studio's decision to keep it in pg-13 territory, its a safer investment and it will reach a larger audience. but that decision also prevents the meg from living up to its true potential. this is supposed to be a prehistoric shark that is bigger and more violent than anything living in the ocean today and considering the subject matter, it comes off tame compared to other r rated shark movies. i don't need to see something on the level of the piranha franchise, but this is too safe. i was disappointed that eli roth was considered to direct but dropped out, not because i'm a huge fan of his (i'm more down the middle on his output) but a filmmaker of his style would have pushed the envelope to make this movie memorable.i have a few minor complaints about other parts of the meg. despite both jason statham and bingbing li turning in decent performances, they have very little romantic chemistry and their budding relationship feels forced. the movie is obviously focused on playing toward the international market and they aren't exactly subtle about it. some of the dialogue is corny and there were a few character decisions that were uneven (they couldn't seem to decide how big of a jerk they wanted to make morris, there are scenes where he's laid-back or compassionate and then others where he's a gigantic tool). also, while the ending finally had that dose of unbelievable action that i had been hoping for, it was too little too late for me.a common closing thought for some of my reviews is that if you saw something you liked in the marketing, you'll probably like the movie. the meg might be the exception to the rule. my friend left the theatre disappointed with the movie because he wanted something off-the-wall bonkers from this premise (which didn't happen). i went in with low expectations and walked away pleasantly surprised even if i can't highly recommend the meg to everyone. if you want to see a shark movie with a decent cast, some capably filmed action and a few scenes that will scare you without going overboard, the meg might be for you. if you're expecting an exploitation movie or a campy thriller, you're going to be disappointed."

"251","the meg 2","rforfilm",2018-08-13,7," the meg is an example of a big budgeted b-movie. it does have good shark action, even if the first half is a slow burn
","it ain't summer without the shark movies! yep, every july, we are treated to shark week on a lot of television networks and a load of shark movies ready to go on netflix. aside from jaws and the shallows, it's hard to find other shark movies i find genuinely. if i do enjoy sand sharks, sharknado, octoshark v.s. barracuda or sharks invade venice, it's for the guilty pleasure factor of how ridiculous they are. everyone has to notice just how many of these shark movies are made. many of them have similar stories where the shark (or sharks) invades, a hero has to redeem him self personally by killing it and that's it. they have to be the easiest stories to write, and thus, probably have no problem being sold.let's also talk about jason statham. he's one of the coolest and most iconic modern action heroes. he's also one of the few white guys in hollywood who happens to be an expert in martial arts while having the muscle mass of a stallone or schwarzenegger. even his movies like the transporter, crank, or revolver make him into his own exploitation stereotype. someone knew it was time to put him and a giant shark together in the meg. a rescue diver jonas (played by jason statham) retires after a mission to rescue scientists is a failure when he leaves early, with not everyone rescued. cut to five years later when a large underwater research facility called the mana one is on the brink of something big; the ability to traverse deeper then any submarine and submersible has gone. when a mission involving one of them goes wrong and breaks down, the head of research dr. zhang (played by winston chao) flies to thailand to get jonas. though he declines at first, he agrees when he discovers his ex wife lori (played by jessica mcnamee) was on there.the mission to get them out is successful, but not only do they find out that a giant shark called a megalodon was responsible for the submersible crashing, but that it has broken through the barrier and is out in the south china sea. jonas, along with a crew that includes suyin zhang (played by li bingbing), mac mackredies (played by cliff curtis) jaxx herd (played by ruby rose) and mana one owner jack morris (played by rainn wilson), they set out to kill the shark before it hits a populated area. if you've seen the trailers for the meg, then your going to get exactly what you've been promised; jason statham versus a giant shark. director jon turteltaub seems to be aware of the abundance of bad shark movies and tries to make one of his own that's fun. does he succeed? for the most part, i did have fun...but it takes some time to get there. in fact, the real shark action doesn't really come into play until halfway into the story. the first half tries to focus on the humans and each of their parts. i wouldn't have a problem with that if they were interesting, but many of them seem to be playing them selves. jason statham is jason statham, ruby rose is ruby rose and rainn wilson is rainn wilson. at the most, it's passable.once the shark does come on screen, things do take off in a more fun manner where at least there isn't a government agency trying to stop them. except with one of the characters with another motive, the goal is simple; kill the shark. even with the pg-13, i definitely got what i wanted.the meg is what you would call a big budgeted ""b-movie"". it's a movie that's trying to have fun with itself without having to rely on too much story or character. to be fair, trying to recreate can be hard if your more used to typical hollywood material. when it came to his previous work like national treasure, last vegas, and cool runnings, jon turteltaub is more of a studio director. visually, he knows how to shoot a b-movie. he needed more work on the script to make that transition. it could have done without the character's dark past and predictable romance, but that's a nitpick.i'll give this seven megaladons out of ten. i can imagine this playing well over tv airings in the next ten years. i can even see myself watching this again if i was board one day with nothing else on. if shark movies are not your thing, then you can skip this. if you are a fan, love jason statham or simple thrillers, then this is something worth biting. just be patient for the shark action."

","the long journey to bring ""the meg"" to the big screen is finally over as author steve alten's classic book series has arrived.the film stars jason statham as jonas taylor, an expert in underwater rescues who has to makes a very difficult choice when a rescue goes bad after suffering a very unexpected encounter mid-rescue.five years later jonas is out of the rescue game as he has been labeled as unreliable and prone to ptsd so he drinks his time away in thailand working on local boats.200 miles off the coasts of china is an advanced research lab which is the pet project of a billionaire named morris (rainn wilson), who arrives in time to witness an attempt by the crew to go deeper than ever thought possible by going through a layer that was previously believed to be the ocean floor. the experiment works and the crew is amazed by their new discoveries until something violently attacks their ship leaving them stranded on the bottom of the ocean.with a limited amount of air and time ticking away, jonas is recruited despite his numerous refusals as not only is one of the stranded people his ex; but the last transmission sent by the sub mentions how jonas had been right all along when he had years early claimed they were not alone during the rescue attempt gone bad.jonas is teamed with a spirited member of the team named suyin (bingbing li), who has taken a sub down ahead of jonas as she was not willing to wait for outside help to arrive. she locates her comrades and is attacked by a massive shark long thought extinct.the harrowing rescue goes off but again jonas is faced with a no-win situation and is blamed by a former colleague for the issues.while morris is eager to exploit the new find for the huge financial opportunity it presents, their plans change when the creature emerges from its contained area and threatens a level of carnage on the seas the likes of which society and the ecosystem are very unprepared for.what follows is a frantic and often intense series of engagements as jonas and the crew must battle the massive and deadly creature and find a way to survive.
the film has some very solid effects and the intensity at times had people in the press screening partially covering their eyes during some of the more harrowing moments.the cast is solid and work well with one another as the film does what it can to keep some of the characters from being little more than generic victims for the meg.the movie does differ from the book in terms of being set off china versus california but this was largely due to the joint-production with chinese owned gravity pictures. the film is also much less gory than the book as director jon turteltaub was mandated to deliver a pg-13 film by the studio to improve the odds of returning on the $150.00 million invested in the film. the dialogue is also a bit stilted and formulaic in parts but action films are not known for their complex plots or advanced dialogue and i attributed this largely to the challenges of a blended cast; many of whom do not speak english as their primary language.despite a delay from its planned 2017 release date, ""the meg"" is a solid and fun action-thriller that gives audiences one of the best excuses not to go swimming since ""jaws"". while there have been numerous shark films over the years, ""the meg"" deftly weaves good sets and production values with a top-notch cast and lavish visuals to bring the film to life.with several other books in the series already available, i hope we see the next film surface in a few years as i cannot wait to see what comes next

(think ""the killing of a sacred deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) this assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. it's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. what's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of rosamund pike, carey mulligan and richard e. grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. and then there's the excessively hammy performance of keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. in all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do. save your money, and don't waste your time on this vastly overrated release from a vastly overrated filmmaker."

","saltburn, directed by emerald fennell (who brought us the excellent a promising young woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the english aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. the film stars barry keoghan as oliver quick, a scholarship student at oxford university, and jacob elordi as felix catton, a charming aristocrat who invites oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, saltburn.saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. it attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. however, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. the film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. oliver, played by keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. felix, played by elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.although fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. the film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. the movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. the movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.the cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. the grandeur of saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. these artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. it's a film that tries to be a critique of the english aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. while it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. it's not a film i'd recommend."

"307","saltburn","reelreviewsandrecommendations",2023-12-23,1," oliver quick & the dead
","it is 2006, and scholarship student oliver quick has just arrived at oxford. he doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. after befriending felix catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, oliver finally seems to find his place at the university. invited to the catton family home- saltburn- for the summer holidays, oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.written and directed by emerald fennell, 'saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. fennell's narrative begins with promise. in the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. however, after the action moves to the manor house, saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'the talented mr. ripley, 'teorema' or 'the servant.'those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. one, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? what made this character the way they are? fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, scouse tom ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. felix is exactly like ripley's object of obsession, dickie greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'the ruling class' among them. familiar and lacking in depth, fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during oliver's intermittent narration.throughout the film, fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. she lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. the ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to liam gallagher's 'once,' starring a thankfully clothed eric cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.conversely, linus sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the catton family. he employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. it is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.however, sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does suzie davies' rich production design. textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which sophie canale's costume design and charlotte dirickx's set decoration compounds. in addition, anthony willis's score is stirring. his original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably sophie ellis-bextor's 'murder on the dancefloor'- complement the narrative.barry keoghan stars as oliver, alongside jacob elordi as felix, alison oliver as felix's sister venetia and rosamund pike as felix's mother elspeth. keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. when playing oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with venetia being clearest evidence of this.elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned greenleaf. he impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while pike steals the show as the eccentric elspeth. richard e. grant also stars, as felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while archie madekwe's grating performance as felix's cousin is smug and one-note.in conclusion, emerald fennell's 'saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. while the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star barry keoghan is inconsistent. although rosamund pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have."

","it must be observed that ""saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. the characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.the catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the british aristocracy belongs in the gutter. the beautiful catton home includes detritus from the past such as shakespeare's first folio and paintings of rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out lords of england.the middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. the parents are proud of their son. he wants them out of his life.even the hallowed halls of the university of oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. the single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.this film will shortly be forgotten. but it leaves a record of a decadent, nihilistic era that has been stripped of the basic values of humanity and civilization."

","the movie was quite enjoyable, albeit slightly too ambitious. it seemed to struggle in balancing between an aristocratic setting, lacking the depth found in works like 'brideshead revisited' or alan hollinghurst's 'the line of beauty', and a psychological thriller aspect, which, while entertaining, came across as overly sensational and somewhat lacking in credibility. at times, the plot developments were so outlandish that they were more amusing than serious. saltburn was on the verge of being a masterpiece with its wealth of excellent content. it's still a worthwhile watch, despite some superficial elements and a feeling that fennell and the screenwriter didn't fully explore their characters, choosing sensationalism instead. quick's portrayal of a sociopath was intriguing yet not entirely convincing, but the film was still an enjoyable experience overall. it has more strengths than weaknesses."

my rating 9/10
in selected cinemas nowsaltburn is the latest movie from the brilliant creative writer, director , producer and actress emerald fennell since her 2020 triumphant movie essay on vengeance promising young woman which starred her friend carey mulligan.carey mulligan only plays a cameo role in saltburn but what a brilliant cameo role it is of poor dear pamela the unwanted dysfunctional house guest.carey mulligan in an interview with margo robbie a co producer of saltburn said that the role emerald fennell originally offered her was not the one she ended up playing. on reading the script carey mulligan said she decided that she wanted to play poor dear pamela and emerald agreed to her request .i'm only assuming the other role offered to her was that of lady elspeth catton played in the movie to perfection by oscar nominee rosamund pike.this movie in fact has four oscar nominees in the cast richard e. grant, barry keoghan, carey mulligan and rosamund pike.it's no wonder to me that emerald fennell it's creator has received numerous accolades, including an academy award, two british academy film awards, one screen actors guild award, and nominations for three primetime emmy awards and three golden globe awards.one reviewer described this movie as a promising young man takes a seedy turn as it follows a young university student who becomes infatuated with his aristocratic schoolmate and his wealthy but eccentric family.my only regret with this movie is the fact that emerald fennell chose the 1.33:1 aspect ratio , her reason being that it gives the impression of ""peeping in.""
the magnificent cinematography by linus sandgren in my opinion deserves the full anamorphic 2.39:1 widescreen aspect.i call this movie an art house black comedy thriller if i had to describe it in a few words i think i would say it's brideshead revisited with the style of peter greenaway the avant- garde director of famous 1980's movies like the draughtsman's contract , drowning by numbers and the cook, the thief, his wife & her lover .this wonderful movie for me was a complete surprise and is now in my top 5 films of 2023 . it may not the be finest of the year but certainly the most original and entertaining in my opinion.not everyone will share my view but i adore clever screenplays about the psychology and obsessional aspects of the human mind especially when tinged with black humour.i couldn't help thinking of evelyn waugh's brideshead revisited while watching saltburn so after seeing the movie i wasn't surprised to read that emerald fennell recommended jacob elordi the brisbane born handsome actor read brideshead revisited to prepare for this important role in his career .in complete contrast jacob will be playing elvis presley in the forthcoming movie pricilla based on the early relationship of pricilla beaulieu and elvis .in saltburn jacob elordi plays the pivotal character of everyone's affection felix catton the son and heir of sir james catton played with delicious detachment by richard e grant and elspeth catton perfectly cast with the glamorous rosamund pike .rosamund pike has never looked as glamorous in a movie her gowns and all the costumes designed by sophie canale who was assistant costume designer on bridgerton are outstanding especially in the spectacular fancy dress masquerade birthday party scene in honour of the family interloper oliver quick also played to perfection by the academy award nominated irish supporting actor barry keoghan in the banshees of inisherin barry keoghan.barry keoghan's character oliver quick is the cuckoo in this nest of privilege , an intelligent young man from a middle class family studying at oxford not because of family wealth but on a scholarship .his character appears benign at first but gradually develops into a complex and devilishly ambitious assault on the upper class family whose hospitality and wealth turns his summer of love into a quest of betrayal.the movie begins with oliver's narrative explaining his obsessional affection for the charismatic felix catton whose life ,family and popularity starkly contrasts oliver's nerdy dullness . oliver through a set of careful manoeuvres manages to enter the world of felix catton and his aristocratic eccentric family.similar to brideshead felix invites oliver to spend the summer at his family's ancestral home saltbush where he is welcomed by the glamorous matriarch elspeth .no spoilers everyone should experience this amazing movie with fresh eyes preferably on a cinema screen as it may look very boxy on a television screen.as mentioned the sets and location shooting are stunning and feature the historic cobbled radcliffe square in oxford and its walled surroundings and colleges.the stately home that emerald fennell chose as saltburn is drayton house in northamptonshire and has never been used for filming before and may never be used again
i haven't mentioned many of the brilliant ensemble cast but the two standouts for me were archie madekwe as the young border at saltburn farleigh start who sees through oliver quick and becomes an object of jealousy.also the beautiful but troubled daughter of the household annabelle played by sadie soverall all the performances including the supercilious scene stealing butler played by paul rhys are wonderful.i'd love to spend a day in emerald fennels mind the characters that inhabit it in the stories she creates in killing eve ,promising young woman and now saltburn i find fascinating."

","saltburn is a story about oliver, portrayed by barry keoghan(love him, who doesn't? i've seen killing of a sacred deer at least 10 times).his infatuation with felix catton, which starts at oxford, quickly spirals into an obsession, leading to some morally ambiguous, if not outright disturbing, choices. what starts as a seemingly innocent attraction, soon morphs into something dark and uncontrollable.what struck me most about saltburn is its clever use of greek mythology as a narrative tool. the parallels drawn between oliver's actions and the story of theseus and the minotaur add a rich layer of symbolism. this mythological reference isn't just a backdrop; it's integral to understanding oliver's character and his journey.the film also delves into the themes of social class and the dichotomy between public persona and private reality. in an age where social media often dictates how we present ourselves to the world, 'saltburn' offers a critical, if not cynical, view of this duality. oliver's character becomes a vessel for exploring these themes, making us question the authenticity of those around us.director emerald fennell doesn't shy away from making bold choices in 'saltburn,' particularly in how the story unfolds. some may find the film's progression and its eventual climax a bit jarring, but i believe it adds to the film's uniqueness. the narrative isn't straightforward, and it's this complexity that makes 'saltburn' stand out.the performances in the film are noteworthy. barry keoghan delivers a nuanced portrayal of oliver, balancing vulnerability with an underlying sense of menace. the supporting cast, including jacob elordi and rosamund pike, also contribute significantly to the film's overall impact. i've been skeptical of them, but i was impressed.in conclusion, saltburn is a thought-provoking film that challenges conventional storytelling. it's a blend of mythology and modernity, a narrative that forces us to confront the darker aspects of desire and ambition. while it may not be everyone's cup of tea (i was grossed out by two scenes, you know the ones), for those who appreciate a film that makes you think and re-evaluate, saltburn is definitely worth a watch. i've been skeptical of them, but i was impressed."

","it doesn't take long to realist that there is nothing particularly original in the plot of this movie. more or less from the outset it promises to be a more debauched, british version of the talented mr ripley, and ultimately it never strays too far from that tag.having thus tempered expectations, there is enough in the first hour or so of this film to offer some encouragement that the film could at least be watchable.our protagonist oliver (barry keoghan) is a scholarship boy at oxford. initially ostracised from the in-crowd by his lack of wealth or social grace, he works his way into the orbit of the charming, dashing and rich felix (jacob elordi), and is ultimately invited to the titular family home. there he is introduced to the bizarre world of the british aristocracy and the idiosyncratic characters that populate it.having established this fish-out-of-water narrative, and despite the sterling efforts of its cast, the plot then begins to drift. we are offered glimpses of what might have been - the relationship between oliver and felix's sister venetia (alison oliver), in particular, briefly offers opportunity for real interest and intrigue - but the film eschews these in favour of a far more well-worn and unchallenging path.as a consequence, the second half of the film - which is written to be rich in twists, reveals and shocks - becomes bland, predictable and - frankly - boring.there are strong performances throughout the film - rosamund pike, as felix's mother, is particularly engaging and amusing, and attempts admirably to carry much of the second half of the film. jacob elordi, though slightly unconvincing as a british aristocrat, looks nevertheless to have a bright future ahead of him. richard e. grant, as felix's father, is good value as well, even if his character is a little one-dimensional.and there are interesting characters who are never properly explored. pamela (carey mulligan) is a guest at saltburn who has overstayed her welcome, but is discarded as swiftly as she is introduced. farleigh (archie madekwe) is oliver's rival for felix's attention and funding, and provides a character that is well-drawn, well-performed and interesting, but again disappears from view in the latter stages of the film. this is particularly disappointing as archie madekwe does a great job of balancing his character's contradictions: intellectual but belligerent, confident but desperate, charming but hostile.the final result has some strong moments and some good performances, but ultimately fails to develop into a worthy film. at 2 hours and 7 minutes in length, it feels at least half an hour too long, and i confess it was ultimately a relief to finally be able to leave the cinema."

","greetings again from the darkness. emerald fennell won an oscar for her original screenplay of her dark and divisive debut feature film, promising young woman (2020). she's back as writer-director of her second feature film, and it's every bit as dark, and even more scathing in its takedown of the rich and entitled. we are also treated to yet another awkwardly disturbed character for the growing resume of barry keoghan.oliver quick (keoghan) is a newly arrived student of the class of 2006 at oxford, and it's clear from the first moment that he doesn't really fit in, whether it's his clothes, not smoking, his uneasiness with his tutor, or his social ineptness. he becomes transfixed on the bmoc, felix catton (jacob elordi, fresh off his turn as elvis in priscilla). felix is tall, handsome, charming, and rich. life comes easy for him, and students are drawn to him - both male and female. he's a modern-day aristocrat, and one day oliver helps him out of a jam. this leads to a bonding, or more like worlds colliding. the first act is devoted to the development of this unexpected friendship, and leads to felix inviting oliver to spend the summer at his family estate ... saltburn.saltburn is nothing short of a magnificent castle. felix's eccentric family includes farleigh (archie madekwe, gran turismo), an adopted ""cousin"" fellow oxfor student who sees all but would never blow this gig; venetia (alison oliver), the total mess of a daughter and sister; poor dear pamela (carey mulligan), the total mess of a houseguest who has overstayed her welcome; sir james catton (richard e grant), the childlike father; and espeth catton (rosamund pike), the former model drama queen passive-aggressive mother. it's a motley crew that puts 'the royal tenenbaums' to shame for entitlement.as the summer progresses, we see oliver in action as he weasels his way into the good graces of some, while creating leverage over others. his non-descript looks, quiet demeanor, and background story lead some to protect him at the same time others distrust him. as viewers, it's obvious to us that something isn't right with oliver, yet director fennell and keoghan's performance keeps us hopeful that things won't become too skewed. those hopes are dashed once we see keoghan's first bathtub scene (and subsequent disturbing moments), and fennell serves up multiple references to his mouth in letting us know it's not to be trusted.the third act goes full dark in a deliciously wicked manner with fennell and oscar winning cinematographer linus sandgren (la la land) creating an old world style within a contemporary world. the film is perfectly cast with elordi quite magnetic as felix, the not-so-obscure object of oliver's desire. madekwe is spot on as the turf-protecting farleigh, and grant and pike make the perfectly mismatched couple of privilege. alison oliver delivers the film's best scene with her bathtub monologue, while keoghan nails the creepy oliver (in line with his roles in the banshees of inisherin, the killing of a sacred deer, and the batman. he has become the go-to psychopath. he even combines humor and horror for his happy naked castle dance in this film that has the talented mr ripley (1999) as its most obvious comparison. ms. fennell strikes another blow against the entitled elite, although we do wish she hadn't spelled out everything to end the film ... a bit of mystique would have worked.opening in theaters on november 22, 2023."

","i'm in utter shock at how good saltburn turned out to be. i was looking forward to it but i didn't expect to be top 5 of the year (maybe even top 10 of the decade) for me. that's only because i really liked promising young woman but i wasn't totally blown away by it. it had so many great concepts and moments but some of the execution was a bit lacking for me. but i can confidently say emerald fennell elevated her craft in every single way for her second movie.this script is almost completely air tight. i was intrigued from almost the first frame and it never let me go from there. fennell's been very open about the influence of the talent mr ripley on this film and it's very apparent but she absolutely does her own thing with it. it doesn't always feel like it's going in a specific direction but i was always excited to see where it was going.this character, played perfectly in what i think is barry keoghan's best performance, is so interesting and i never quite knew how to feel about him in all the best ways. fennell builds up his connection with jacob elordi so well and there's such a specific chemistry between the 2 of them that was riveting to watch and they took elrodi's character in a direction i didn't expect but absolutely loved.i won't go as far as to say that i didn't predict any of the twists or turns. there were some reveals that i did see coming but it all comes down to execution and every single beat and plot revelation of this script felt earned from a character perspective and took everything to a satisfying conclusion. i've already mentioned the mr ripley inspiration but there's a little knives out in there, some illusions to parasite, hints to get out and even the shining.that's not to say fennell is being derivative here because this film absolutely feels like her vision through and through and it's so impressive just how many tones she managed to blend seamlessly. my only real issue with the script, and really the film overall, is fennell's need to occasionally over explain things. there's a lot of backstory to these characters but the means in which she delivers the exposition around them can feel forced and like the scene just has to stop to fill in their history. certain scenes towards the end makes these moments more understandable in retrospect but it still felt clunky in the moment.the technical prowess on display was astounding. based off the trailers, i wasn't sure if i was going to like the unique aspect ratio this film employs but it ended up working perfectly for me. it gave a sense of intimacy to everything and it let me get more immersed into the character interactions and even the broader landscape shots as well. the camerawork fennell pulls of here is insane, there are so many impressive one takes and it has without a doubt one of the most unique final shots i've seen in a movie in a long time. the cinematography is also jaw dropping, it's roger deakins level stuff for me and it honestly made my jaw drop more than once. if it doesn't get nominated for, let alone win, the oscar i'll be outraged.saltburn is such an experience of a movie that i can't help but in awe of what emerald fennell pulled off. it's constantly intriguing, tension filled and investing despite the truly horrible acts done by the characters. it's visually stunning with some of the best performances i've seen from most of these actors. it hasn't left my mind in the day since i saw it and it just feels like the kind of movie we don't see enough of. amazon are absolutely killing it this year with air and now this and they need to keep putting these kinds of movies in theatres. after this, i can't wait to see what emerald fennell does next because if she puts out another film of this quality she'll be well on her way to being one of the best directors working right now."

","oliver, a seemingly working-class oxford student, falls in with a group of upper-class kids, one of whom invites him to his huge old stately home (saltburn) and may be an object of obsession for him. oliver is thus, or roughly thus, led into elaborate lies and worse. my uncertainties here are because the plot is never really clear.it's probably not a deliberate irony that the film often appears to want to be the talented mr. ripley, possibly the greatest story ever about wanting to be someone else. unfortunately, it also apes, by turns, brideshead revisited, the servant and the little stranger. these impulses are not compatible and all said precursors are vastly superior.the script's one real strength lies in the area where writer-director emerald fennel was, presumably, able to write what she knows not from other people's art but her own experience: an upper-class british person herself, her depictions of upper-class british people are mercilessly perfect, ably abetted by very funny performances from richard e. grant and, especially, rosamund pike.but that accounts for about five minutes in an otherwise quite astonishingly amateurish mess. oliver is either the sad sexual obsessive of ripley or the single-mindedly sociopathic revanchist class warrior of the servant. the two do not go together; the only real guiding principle seems to be whatever transgressive, would-be shocking image fennel wants to show us. furthermore, in class warrior guise, oliver is supposed to be carrying out an elaborate, precisely calibrated, 5d chess stratagem that in reality depends on absurdly impossible luck and the fog-brained gullibility of everyone else concerned.this review is a rewrite. fennel should, at best, have done more of those herself. her film's grainy, grimy, fashion-shoot prettiness, which seduced me a little at first - hence the rewrite - has soured over time like perfume used to cover up the smell of putrefying corpses. it's bad enough that fennel has written characters stupid enough to be duped by such transparent ruses. it's wqrse that she seems to expect this of her viewers too - and perhaps even a little worse yet that some of them, on the evidence of these reviews, have fallen in line."

","it's 2006. oliver quick (barry keoghan) is an outsider nerd in oxford university. most of the other students seem to be upper-crust from the cool kids' table. the head of that table is felix catton (jacob elordi). oliver works to befriend felix who invites oliver to his family's estate called saltburn to join his parents (richard e. grant, rosamund pike), his sister venetia (alison oliver), his less-well-off cousin farleigh start (archie madekwe), and poor dear pamela (carey mulligan).this is emerald fennell's second directorial full length theatrical movie. she hit the first one out of the park with the critics and everybody is expecting a lot from her. i love this one more than ""promising young woman"". that seems to be a minority opinion. certainly, the style and the daring and the edge are all right there in both movies. in this one, i'm not questioning the reality of the situation.it all boils down to barry keoghan. his eyes are so unique. he looks both innocent and like a serial killer. from the beginning, i am assuming that he is inject little lies to get into the inner circle. i just couldn't understand his feelings for felix. that's why i love his final explanation of both loving and hating him. i thought he had a misstep dealing with venetia. he should have neg her by saying she failed his demand to eat. that would have kept her wrapped around his finger. the movie's biggest misstep is the section with the reveals. the first reveal of the bicycle tire is great. the money at the bar is interesting, but it's not that surprising. at the time, the audience thought he's poor, but by the end, we know he has middle class money. the farleigh reveal is no reveal. anybody with a brain knows what happened. the felix reveal is only interesting in its details. the venetia reveal is problematic in that her suicide needs to be expanded right away. by then, the audience knows oliver is doing the killings. as for elspeth, i would have prefer a marriage first and that murder is too blatant. the whole last act is a bit of a stumble, but i do love the rest."

","prepare to be subjected to a barrage of pretentiousness, boredom, and gratuitously disturbing content in saltburn, a film that fails spectacularly on every level. this pretentious, nonsensical, and disturbing film is a cinematic abomination that will leave you questioning the sanity of its creators and the critics who have showered it with praise.from the very first scene, you'll be bombarded by the film's overly stylized visuals and pretentious dialogue, which, in this case, is not just a gimmick but a deliberate attempt to mask the film's lack of substance. the 1.37:1 aspect ratio, reminiscent of classic films, is used as a crutch, not a tool, to elevate what is essentially a shallow and pretentious mess.the film's characters are a walking disaster zone, a collection of vapid and morally questionable individuals whose actions are as questionable as their motivations. their dialogue is cringeworthy, their actions are nonsensical, and their overall presence is utterly repellent. you'll find yourself struggling to identify with any of them, let alone care about their lives.the plot, if you can call it that, is a convoluted mess of twists and turns that serve no purpose but to confuse and disgust. the film tries to be edgy and suspenseful, but it's just plain gross and exploitative. you'll find yourself squirming in your seat as you witness the characters engage in their endless stream of pretentious conversations, over-the-top dramatics, and graphic, disturbing scenes.saltburn's attempts to be ""edgy"" and ""shocking"" with its gratuitously explicit content and morally reprehensible characters only make it more unbearable. it's as if the filmmakers were trying too hard to shock and offend, but they failed miserably.saltburn is a prime example of how style can't compensate for a complete lack of taste and substance. the film is visually unappealing, the characters are utterly forgettable, and the plot is a nonsensical mess. if you're looking for an engaging and entertaining film, steer clear of saltburn. you're better off watching paint dry."

overall, a bold attempt at a grand movie in emerald fennell's sophomore effort as she really builds the grand world of saltburn through cinematography and production design and gets a lot out of her actors (especially barry keoghan and jacob elordi), but, in the end, is held back by having too many continuity issues/loose ends and going overboard with the more grotesque scenes.decent to pretty good direction (controlled her scenes well on a macro-scale as she used the cinematography and the sets to tell how grandiose saltburn was (and the dichotomy of how closed off everyone was because of it); did a pretty good job on a micro scale as the one-on-one scenes were good (especially the ones between keoghan and elordi) but the group scenes were not that well executed; the storytelling is overall decent as the overarching story is encapsulated well but the movement between plot points is not as fluid as it could be (with there being some easily spotted continuity issues); some scenes felt very elongated for no reason and were just really meant to shock rather than have any substance), good to very good acting (very good from barry keoghan (really captures the persona of this demented hero well as he shows the lengths the protagonist will go to get what he wants), very good from jacob elordi (really uses his charisma and looks to help propel his performance as he really takes control of all the scenes he is in to act as this heavenly god that the main character is trying to chase), good to very good from rosamund pike (plays the dull/out-of-touch character well and has that elitist british tone that helps with her character), good to very good from richard e. grant (similiar to pike in that he plays a dull/out-of-touch character well), good from alison oliver (has a lot of moments that are good as her character's emotional instability helps portray a young adolescent), good from archie madekwe (plays his character well and has good chemistry being at odds with keoghan), good from carey mulligan (more of a cameo appearance but does a good job in letting her presence be known), good from the rest of the cast (each actor plays their role well as they work off of the main cast)), pretty bad story (the overarching story is interesting and has a lot of mystery to it as the director slowly peels at what is actually going on; the storytelling is not the best as there are a lot of continuity errors (like superbad being played on dvd before it is even out in theaters) and is not that clear at points; the characters were written well and have their clear purpose in the story (with the mystery of the lead character helping drive the story forward); there were just the right amount of plot points (it just felt like some of the overall scenes could have been cut down a bit); the movie does not tie everything up well (and this hurts the story as it is not meant to really have things left open to interpretation)), decent to pretty good screenplay (the dialogue flowed very well and felt like it was of the time and the place; the symbolism is somewhat there but it does not help with portraying the message; the foreshadowing was good as it helped with showing who the main character really is (and was not that predictable)), pretty good score/good soundtrack (really helped with setting the time), incredible cinematography (really felt very grand and helped with showing how big and lost you can be in saltburn), bad sound (the dialogue was not mixed well as a lot of times it was unclear what they were saying or the music was too loud that the dialogue just felt inaudible), decent editing (overall was good and helped with showing how grand saltburn was and how small the subjects were inside it; some of the scenes felt just unnecessarily long and could have been cut to provide the same effect (especially for the more grotesque scenes)), great production design (the sets in saltburn were just so grand and illustrious that they helped with showing the wealth the family had; the college sets were all very stunning as they helped show the history of the school; the party (and aftermath) was designed very well to just show how many people were there), plot structure was good as the points were laid out well and each overall component helped build to the next one (it is just inside of these components it did not feel like the story progressed well between scenes)runtime could have been cut down by making some of the scenes sorter as it would not have that much effect on the story (shaving maybe 5-10 minutes), pacing was fine as it did not feel like it was too fast or slow, climax was decently executed as it is presented in a very shocking way (but the more you think about it the more holes you see in the continuity), tone was very similar to a coming-of-age mixed with a thriller and high-class british themes as this helps show the world the main character is living in, saw a premiere at austin film festival; the grotesque scenes were a bold choice but it does not pay off that well as it just makes the audience feel uneasy than actually showing how deranged some of the actions and characters were."

","'saltburn (2023)' is an incredibly horny movie. it's easily one of the most bisexual films i've seen at the cinema, with a down-bad lead who seemingly wants to have sex with everyone he meets and cinematography that frames the characters as if any of them could start making out with one another at any given moment. seriously, it's as if the camera operators themselves want to get in on the action. pretty much every major player - jacob elordi's felix, in particular - is shot with a sweaty sexuality that lends them an almost ethereal allure. it's like they're actively trying to seduce you through the screen, which the picture itself is attempting in its own way. the female gaze doesn't really exist, but if it did it would look like this; i finally know something about what it must feel like for a straight woman to watch, well, practically anything with a 'sexy' female character in it. at a certain point, the sexual tension snaps with a series of unashamedly shocking, near gross-out gags involving various bodily fluids and unexpected sex acts. the audience i was watching this with were audibly squirming in their seats at some of the more outrageous moments, and perhaps rightfully so. these are undoubtedly the moments which have caused many people to declare the back half of this ""really weird"", and they do kind of come out of nowhere - if not in their inclusion then in their perceived depravity. however, i don't think the second half of the flick is any less successful than the first, and it actually feels like a fairly natural progression of the plot. it's unorthodox, sure, and it starts to sew the first seeds in your mind that maybe the protagonist isn't quite as innocent as he first appears. the general subversiveness of the story does go quite a long way in keeping you invested, as you're never quite sure what's going to happen next or what the characters are actually thinking (or if they're even thinking at all). there's something off about everything at saltburn from the moment it's introduced, and the flick builds this underlying sense of suspense that kind of sneaks up on you. even if its ultimate reveal is handled fairly clumsily, most of the narrative is compelling enough to mostly justify the 130-minute runtime. it helps that the performances are all rock solid, including some expectedly fantastic work from barry keoghan, and that the writing keenly balances dark absurdism with disturbing satire. the cinematography has an appealing almost polaroid - or perhaps 8mm home movie - feel thanks to its 4:3 framing and notable film grain. the film is comprised almost exclusively of interestingly framed, often downright beautiful shots that frequently make perfect use of silhouette and satisfyingly unconventional composition. it's all edited together in a notably excellent fashion, featuring some bracingly vibrant montages that make use of repeated motifs to recontextualise previously seen material. it's a really well-made movie overall, and its narrative is more consistent than a lot of people seem to think. it does get ever-so-slightly repetitive in its midsection and some of its first act could arguably be trimmed, but it's a consistently engaging and darkly funny / funnily dark experience for most of its duration. the ending is a little inelegant, the theming isn't particularly deep and some of its more outlandish moments feel crafted almost solely for shock value, but this is a solid and unconventional feature that almost defies genre and is all the better for it."

","actress/writer/director emerald fennell is turning into an artistic voice that bears noticing and with saltburn - her follow-up to promising young woman (the film that won her the academy award for best original screenplay) - fennell's artistic voice is in full bloom.starring barry keoghan (oscar nominated for the banshees of inisherin), saltburn tells the story of an oxford student who befriends the rich, cool kid (jacob elordi, euphoria) who invites him back to his family compound, saltburn, for the summer with his eccentric (to say the least) family.as written and directed by fennell, saltburn is a satire on the elite rich, showing them in their extravagant, quirky isolation in their compound, looking down on the common folk from their piles of money (or...in some cases...oblivious of the common folk because of their money) while peeling back the layers to show the unhappiness and manipulation underneath.fennell layers this story richly, slowly folding back facades and layers to show the ugliness of inherently unhappy people who cover their unhappiness up with wealth, money and parties.into this world comes oliver quick (keoghan) who is the audiences' conduit into this level of living - and who has secrets of his own.keoghan is interesting to watch (as always) and the family...elordi, sadie soverall (his sister) and archie madekwe (another outsider who is jealous of oliver's appearance) all are good looking, good enough performers who live the hedonistic lifestyle and deny the consequences and responsibilities thereof.when a film needs an ""ice queen"" as the matriarch of a family, rosamund pike is, inevitably, brought in and she brings the goods to saltburn. she is perfectly cast as the mother of the family who says what she thinks, does not show what she is feeling and doesn't give a darn about anyone else. she is suitably balanced by the off-balanced, quirky performance of the always good richard e. grant as the patriarch of the family who is (usually) lost in his own little world of whatever fantasy he is currently involved in.but if this was just a film about a quirky family, it would be a fun, interesting romp. but...in fennell's hands, it becomes something much more sinister - and much more interesting - to watch.saltburn is a film that one must sit with after watching to digest what was just witnessed, but...ultimately...is one that is very interesting....and intriguing...and dark.letter grade: b+7 1/2 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the bank(ofmarquis)"

","saltburn is a crazed caricature. absurdist to the nth degree. it's punctuated with the allure of witty, pithy dialogue and outrageous characters, but the plot doesn't pull its weight through to any real finality. the shock-value is cranked up to the maximum, an overplayed hand; with only anticlimax to show for it. the payoff only lands softly as the film slowly meanders to sophie ellis-bextor's iconic early 2000s ""murder on the dancefloor"" backed credits. saltburn is a publicity stunt, it desperately wants to rile and provoke, to be talked about by urgently grabbing the viewer's attention by means of shock-value, and secondly allowing the director's more subtle commentary on class to be discovered after the fact. in its open-endedness, it struggles to justify the point of its own existence in the midst of its attention-seeking rhetoric. it tries so hard to be idiosyncratic that it at times becomes somewhat overexposed, and errs to state the obvious.the film's director, emerald fennell, hails from the same upper classes she targets. we are offered her insider's take; her ace in the hole that populates the script with hilariously classist opines, jabs, and devilish quips. fennell satirically imagines both halves of society; one half envious, clamouring, coveting, pining, self-conscious, and scheming, the other half decadent, proud, sneering, prideful, and detached. but nothing said here hasn't been said elsewhere in the ""eat-the-rich"" discussion. nonetheless, the issue is less the originality of what is said overall, but instead *how* things are said. i would say this could be the most intricate exploration and representation of class behaviour, at least in british culture, ever put to the cinema screen. this is a story of the haves and the moth-like want-mores. even despite it being quite clearly derivative from the likes of mr. ripley.saltburn's cast is a strong point, with standout performances from barry keoghan, jacob elordi, rosamund pike, and richard e. grant. but keoghan's character is ultimately a maniac without a cause. however, seen as a black comedy caricature through the lense of marxian class theory, saltburn's value can be truly felt.7.4/10."

","set in the early 2000s, oliver quick (barry keoghan) is a working-class student on scholarship to oxford where he often finds himself isolated due to the cultural divide between him and the other attending students. after befriending wealthy student felix catton (jacob elordi), oliver is invited to spend the summer at felix's family estate saltburn where he meets the eccentric catton family consisting of sir james (richard e. grant) and lady elspeth (rosmund pike), felix's siter venetia (alison oliver), and their cousin farleigh (archie madekwe) who makes no secret of his disdain for oliver. over the course of the summer, oliver ingrains himself into the lifestyle of the cattons until darker revelations reveal themselves and send ripples throughout the catton family and estate.saltburn is this sophomore feature of emerald fennell who previously made a name for herself with 2020's promising young woman. taking inspiration from country house set stories, fennell creates some characters who are despicable but also oddly compelling in a story that takes its time in setup before building to a strong and memorable finish.in terms of acting, saltburn is a fantastic showcase for an ensemble cast with not only the catton family made up of status conscious snobs whose atrocious attitudes are either worn on their sleeves or hidden behind a transparent veil of empty sympathy. all of the characters have some flaw be it in a tenuous grasp on status as is the case with farleigh, a hunger for validation in the case of venetia, or in felix's tendency to pick-up lower class ""strays"". barry keoghan is absolutely fantastic in the role of oliver quick and what starts out as a seemingly innocuous observer into this world of opulence and wealth is soon revealed to be a rich multi-layered portrayal that becomes increasingly absorbing minute by minute as keoghan has to act out certain grotesque or off-putting scenes that would be a challenge for most actors.in terms of the writing, saltburn initially seems like it's trying to position itself as an ""eat the rich"" type story in the vein of the menu or glass onion, but while that element is there i'd say the movie has more in common with the works of patricia highsmith in how it becomes a psychological game of wits as filtered through this satirical drama in a countryside house. i can't give too much away but the movie builds an uneasy voyeuristic atmosphere that culminates in a devious and wicked ending. the movie won't be for everyone as there are sequences that are difficult to watch due to how uncomfortable they are (even if they are well acted), and scenes involving a bathtub or late night rendezvous in the garden will definitely not be for the squeamish.while saltburn took its time in setting up its story, i was ultimately satisfied with the route it took and the payoff it built up to. the movie features excellent acting across the board especially from its lead barry keoghan who creates one of the most memorably off-putting protagonists i've seen in some time."

","barry keoghan plays oliver, a quiet introvert on a scholarship at oxford university, who becomes enamoured by the cool and popular guy on campus felix (played by jacob elordi). a chance encounter allows the two to meet and become friends, and when a family tragedy strikes oliver, he is invited by felix to stay at his family's manor 'saltburn' over the summer break. there we are introduced to felix's' eccentric but equally alluring family. oliver is intimidated by each of them, but desperately wants to fit in too, and over the course of the film, his character and values change as the debauchery increases. the film includes plenty of sex, drugs, death and twists to keep the audience both entertained and intrigued throughout, but there is also a high level of shock value that may put people off as well.i'd briefly seen the trailer when it was first released, but had soon forgotten about it, and since the film's official release, all i've heard is how wild and unexpected it is. of course i had to give it a go to see what all the fuss was about. i must say, i agree with all the comments, but aside from how wild it is, its actually an amazing film, full of complex characters.rosamund pike is a great actor, and she's chosen some pretty iconic roles in her career. her portrayal of felix's mother elspeth continues that trend, and the character was worthy of her own film. elspeth reminded me so much of belinda bromilow's aunt elizabeth from 'the great' and her accent was positively delightful. she delivered some scene stealing one liners, and i really hope she garners more than a few awards for the role.jacob elordi is proving to be a versatile actor, and although his english accent wasn't a complete fail, it sounded obviously put on. he also looked 5 meters tall next to the vertically challenged barry keoghan. felix was the epitome of a golden boy, who had everything. girls want to date him, guys wanted to be him (and let's face it, date him too) and he was effortlessly charming.at first, barry keoghan looked too old to be playing a college student, and although in real life he is 31, if i were told he was 51, i'd believe it. i was impressed by his acting, and he played the shy and eager-to-please character so well. i really connected with oliver when he first arrived at saltburn, as it reminded me of being invited on holidays with a friend's family and wanting to be accepted by them. when oliver's character suddenly changes half way through the film, it was unexpected and a little unnerving. there were some subtle hints at a werewolf or a jekyll and hide story that didn't eventuate, but the film could have easily taken either direction. oliver was such an interesting character who evoked empathy from the audience for most of the film. it was a real ballsy (pun intended) performance from keoghan, one that he will be remembered for throughout his career.alison oliver as felix's sister venetia gets an honourable mention, as she was one of the more complex characters who was given some tough material to work with.one of the many highlights for me was the film's cinematography. it's choices of colour, lighting and setting showed romance, grandeur and so much emotion. there were several shots that would make amazing pieces of art as stills, and i enjoyed the symbolism throughout such as the frequent use of mirror images and reflections. the costuming was also great, especially those worn by the women. there was an awesome soundtrack too from the early 2000's, and the use of sophie ellis-bexter's hit 'murder on the dancefloor' in the final scene was the icing on the cake.the only negatives i had with this film were some of the more controversial and graphic scenes (the details of which i will not spoil), which i understand added to the tone of the film, but to me, were a bit too gross and confronting. the other negative i had was how they used (or didn't) the brilliant carey mulligan. her character of poor dear pamela looked to be just as iconic as elspeth in her first scene, however it was her only scene, and she was quickly written out of the rest of the film. i understand cameos, but don't give such a celebrated actor a great role, only for it to be 20 seconds of screen time or less.saltburn stands as a testament to the artistry of modern cinema, radiating an aura of darkness and mystery, with a narrative that is as seductive as it is intriguing and shocking. it embraces its provocative nature but gives its characters purpose as well as beauty that shines through."

","here's a strange one. i guess it's fairly unique. it's one of those movies that only really grabs you right at the end, when it pulls its twist out, and maybe makes you want to go back and re-watch.i don't know if i will though. probably the only parts of this movie i'll remember, if any, will be memorable for how disgusting they were. in one scene, barry keoghan slurps at semen-laced bathwater after jacob elordi has burped the worm in the tub, and in another scene, we see keoghan's lips red with blood after he goes down on a menstruating woman. both pretty gross.there's no denying that keoghan has something. his character here reminded me of the one he played in ""killing of a sacred deer"". remote and unsettling. his small, blue eyes seem to see everything, but his homely face gives nothing away.i kept thinking that keoghan is like one of those old-style movie stars like james cagney or humphrey bogart. despite his unconventional looks and short stature he just has something that makes you want to watch him.elordi, on the other hand, i'm still not sure of. he reminds me of armie hammer. tall, too hollywood handsome. boring. without a style of his own. playing against keoghan, they're like polar opposites. elordi looks like a model whose face you'd see on the wall of a hair salon. you forget what he looks like. keoghan, though? there's a face you can't forget, which, again, is just like cagney, bogart, robinson.as i say, i might re-watch this movie to see if i like it any better the second time. not sure if i will though. the twist was impressive, but it was a pretty hard slog to get to it."

","it's hard not to think of ""brideshead revisited"": the ""common"" student who's invited by his rich college friend to stay on their grandiose family castle. but here things take a very different and sinister turn: oliver, the inconspicuous guest, triggered by an obsessive but unrequited love for his handsome friend felix, gradually weaves a machiavellistic web of lies and insinuations in which not only his friend, but the whole family gets (fatally) entangled. the movie is for the major part a real slow burner, carefully building up the suspense towards a dramatic climax, after which the pace changes to a cascade of cautiously orchestrated, almost understated violence.the settings in a downton abbey-like castle and gardens are breathtaking, the cinematography is impressive, the dialogues are great (and at times hilarious, as with mother elspeth and her guests!), and there's a brooding and sensuous atmosphere. but it's especially the acting that stands out: rosamund pike does a great job as mother elspeth, and jacob elordi proves that he is not just a gorgeous face and body, he totally stands his own as the spoilt and blas√©, but well-meaning felix. the pivot of the movie however is barry keoghan, he is absolutely excellent as either the obsessed but forlorn lover-from-afar, as well as the scheming and sly avenger. maybe keoghan should be aware not to be too much typecasted in this kind of weird roles, but oh boy, how well does he do it!are there no flaws? yes, if you like to nitpick. in the last say twenty minutes the dramatic and spectacular turns rather tumble over each other, which made it feel a bit rushed. as did the epilogue in which oliver reveals his actions, it was too explanatory for my taste, i had liked it better to draw my own conclusions. at one time there was mention of a police investigation, but this dead-ended; in view of the following casualties it's hard to believe that they didn't take it further and at least put oliver to the test. but these few reservations didn't weigh up to all the wonderful and impressive rest. and the closing scene of oliver dancing shamelessly through the rooms of the castle was absolutely priceless!"
"532","saltburn","cscott2331",2023-12-23,8," weird! but that's okay.
","okay so i thought most of the movie was odd some parts a little humorous. like more of a dry dark whit. the parents were the funny ones. some parts seemed unnecessary and strange(bathtub) or maybe as the story progressed we needed to know just how demented everyone is haha. then there are some parts that you're like... what??? like i thought 56 minutes in was going to be the weirdest part, ummm no i was wrong, at one hour 45 minutes in, yeah i'm gonna say that part takes the cake! then the following scene, alison carver(venetia) was amazing!! she did a fabulous job. truthfully one of the reasons i didn't like this more was barry keoghan(oliver) for me he just wasn't charming enough for his role. i don't know, just something never clicked with me. he just couldn't pull off the savviness his character should've had. then we have the finale, the last few minutes actually changed how i felt. great ending, they left nothing to the imagination. it's not going to be for everyone but if you like a character study that's got some crazy $hit in it, well this is probably for you."

","i've been reading the reviews and admiring the film aficionados. they certainly know their stuff and have a lot of films to compare it to. they know the actors' previous performances and comparable films. kudos.unless a film is extraordinary, i will have forgotten it and its title within days of watching it. the closest i get to knowing an actor is recognising their face from another film and looking up to seeing what films they played in.coming at it from that perspective, i really liked (and disliked?) this film. i can usually always guess the ""bad guy"" in films. in this film i couldn't tell who was the bad guy.oliver was creepy from the start. he was obviously obsessed with felix. but you couldn't tell if it was hero adoration, brotherly love or lust. felix was nice - for being upperclass. the rest of felix's crowd were snobby and condescending and rude, but felix seemed to genuinely like oliver. whether he liked oliver or whether it was like having an exotic pet was never clear.oliver gets to saltburn and this is where other reviewers seem to get a bit irate. actually, i thought the screenwriting might be pretty accurate. the family was... well a family. a family with far too much money and nothing to do except relieve their boredom. with nothing to do and probably not much exposure to the real world, i can see a summer there being pretty much the way it was. and with little exposure to the real world, oliver's tales of his dreadful life (divulged to felix in confidence) made oliver the exotic he was.naturally, anyone would want to stay there, with his idol, felix, so oliver tries to get in everyone's good graces in whatever way he can, including turning on the charm & seduction skills. which just makes him more creepy.but it's never clear to me why. because he loves felix and wants to be with him? as a brother? a lover? to be him? was the bathtub scene sexual or trying to somehow absorb felix's essence to be more like him?the scene with the sister could be interpreted the same way. was he trying to win her over, help her, or humiliate her?his motive for acceptance was clear, but why he wanted to be accepted never was. so, logically, i at least tentatively accepted that he wanted to be included in the rich lifestyle with felix, as part of felix's life.i really liked felix and thought the character was genuinely nice, if a bit self- absorbed. no, i don't think he was even that. he would notice when felix needed help - and he would help without hesitation. but felix was obviously into girls, so it couldn't have been a partner oliver was angling for. oliver never asked for anything, so that left a hero or a brother.i don't really want to do spoilers, though people may have already seen them.but there are twists that change the direction of the plot so you don't know where it's going at all. i didn't see the twists coming. and every moving we watch, i guess what is going to happen and disgust my partner when it happens.the very end was lame and i don't believe for a minute that the police wouldn't have been called and oliver found out. and even the very very end was just a contradiction. earlier in the movie everyone had seemed impressed with his nude body.parts. the nudity at the end...it wasn't that impressive. i think the dancing through the house scene was to make viewers wonder if he had murdered the snooty butler.that's the mystery we will never get the answer to.it was beautifully filmed, beautiful costumes, great acting (except oliver, but maybe he is really not a creepy guy and worked hard to be so creepy). great settings and good music.yes, there were some ewww moments. but in my opinion, they weren't there just to shock but to keep viewers confused as to who oliver really was and what he was about."

","there is a lot to unpack with this film. beginning with the main character, oliver quick, whose personality is drab and generally unlikeable. i understand that this is the point, and that the only reason he is at all interesting as a character is due to the lies he tells and his somewhat inconsistent motivations. i had assumed, in the beginning, that oliver's obsession with felix is due to him falling in love with him or having a crush. this belief was somewhat corroborated by his actions (such as the infamous bathtub and graveyeard scenes). it is entirely possible that this was the case, and oliver only killed felix and his family due to his lies crumbling apart and felix learning the truth. oliver clearly fell in love with the lifestyle that felix and his family had at saltburn and when it became clear that felix was cutting him out of his life for lying to him, oliver clawed desperately at any chance to keep this lifestyle, leading him to kill his only friend.i enjoyed the aspect of having to put together the pieces to understand the whole story, and my interpretation may not be correct, as of course there are some inconsistencies with oliver's motivations, especially towards the end. i also have to make a point that the actors in this film are incredible and portray their characters in a way that is believable and realistic.i did however find this film to be a bit slow, and dialogue heavy. most of what this film relies on is the shock value of many of its more r rated scenes. these scenes of course received a lot of attention online, and were what hyped this film up so much. i probably would not have watched it if it were not for the hype, and these scenes that were so overly hyped where rather tame. (i may be a poor judge on this due to having been chronically online as a child and having read many disturbing fan-fictions online).beyond these points, the ending is a bit unbelievable as you have to believe that he could get away with killing all of these people and somehow gain their inheritance without anyone catching on. not a single person questions felix's or venetia's deaths or makes the connection that oliver is in the middle of this tragedy (someone would make the connection that suddenly the family members are dropping like flies and oliver is the only new thing in their lives). and elspeth's motivations for keeping oliver around after her entire family is dead is so strange, besides why she would make him the sole beneficiary of her inheritance. she only knew him for a couple months before her family died, it's not like she had a close connection with him.overall, it's a bit confusing how everything plays out in the end. there are a few loose ends and questions that remain unanswered, which prevents this film from rating higher than a 6/10."

","i'd seen the trailer in the cinema numerous times, it looked interesting, mark kermode made it even more intriguing, and being produced, written, and directed by emerald fennell (promising young woman) and having some good names in the cast i was definitely up for it. basically, set in 2006, scholarship student oliver quick (barry keoghan) begins attending oxford university. he struggles to fit in and lacks upper-class sensibilities and the same privileges that many students have from their wealthy parents. he does have conversations with michael gavey (ewan mitchell) who wants to be his friend, but then oliver notices affluent and popular student felix catton (jacob elordi). he eventually strikes up a friendship with felix after helping him when his bicycle wheel has a puncture. felix invites oliver to join him and his group of friends for a drink in the pub, leaving michael who dislikes felix. felix is empathetic to oliver's stories, including his parents having substance abuse problems and mental health issues. felix makes a consistent effort to include him despite disapproval from his other oxford friends, including his american cousin farleigh start (gran turismo's archie madekwe). their friendship grows over the course of the year, but felix becomes annoyed with oliver's constant presence, and they have a small spat. one night, oliver learns that his father has died and shows up distraught at felix's door. felix comforts him, and knowing that he has nowhere to go, invites him to spend the summer at his family's large estate, saltburn. at saltburn, oliver is introduced to felix's parents, sir james (richard e. grant) and lady elspeth (rosamund pike), and his sister venetia (alison oliver). also staying at saltburn are farleigh and family friend poor dear pamela (carey mulligan). oliver quickly wins over felix's family, who are sympathetic to his situation and amused by his lack of social graces. elspeth is fascinated by him as they bond together, and he grows increasingly comfortable at saltburn. for a few nights, oliver sees venetia in a drunken state wandering the grounds. one night, he meets with her in the house garden, and after some conversation performs oral sex on her. farleigh witnessed this and goads oliver about telling felix about it. when confronted by felix, oliver lies that it was venetia who initiated the act, and he immediately cuts her out from the family. meanwhile, oliver's obsession with felix grows stronger. one night, he watches felix masturbate in the bath, and he drinks the bath water and licks the plug after felix leaves. tensions between oliver and farleigh reach breaking point when during a karaoke party they have a flirtatious moment, and farleigh tricks oliver into performing ""rent"" by pet shop boys in front of the family. later that night, oliver goes into farleigh's room, gives him a handjob while also threatening him. the next morning, farleigh is forced to leave saltburn after it is said that he was trying to steal valuables from the house. later, while oliver is with felix and elspeth, she casually mentions that pamela has died, apparently committing suicide. as the summer draws to a close, elspeth and james plan an elaborate party to celebrate oliver's birthday. the morning of the party, felix surprises oliver after organising to visit his estranged mother paula (dorothy atkinson), answering a call from her on his phone. oliver resists, but felix insists that he try to repair their relationship. however, arriving at his mother's house, oliver's background stories have been fabricated: his father jeff (shaun dooley) is alive, and his parents live in a respectable upper-middle-class suburb. felix is angered by oliver's deception and wants him to leave saltburn after the party. during the extravagant celebrations, oliver encounters farleigh, who reminds him that he will always be an outsider to their lifestyle. hundreds of guests are there to sing ""happy birthday to you"" but it is apparent many can't remember oliver's name. desperate to reconcile with felix, oliver follows him into saltburn's large hedge maze. he interrupts felix having sex with a female guest who runs away, he feels hurt and confusion over oliver's actions. oliver tries to reason and perhaps flirt with him, but ultimately felix rejects him and says he needs professional help. the next morning, felix is found dead in the middle of the maze. during a tense family lunch, oliver mentions that the night before farleigh was taking and handing out drugs, implying a possible connection to felix's death. james banishes farleigh from saltburn and cuts off all his financial support. after felix's funeral, the cattons question oliver's presence, despite this, elspeth insists that he may stay at saltburn. oliver mourns felix desperately, returning to his grave, taking off his trousers and underwear, and penetrating the soil. one night, venetia is in the bath distraught and inebriated. she accuses oliver of disintegrating her family. he tries to seduce her again, but she is disturbed by his behaviour and rebuffs him. the following morning, venetia is found dead in the bath, apparently suicide after slitting her wrists. james, despondent and suspicious of oliver's continuing presence at saltburn, asks him to leave. oliver repeatedly insists that he cannot leave elspeth in her hysterical state. but james realises oliver is manipulative and furiously bribes him to disappear and never contact them again. years later, oliver is in a caf√© reading a newspaper with an article that james has died. there, he has a chance encounter with elspeth who is delighted to see him. she insists that he return with her to saltburn, having not been there in some time herself. they spend several months together, but elspeth suddenly falls fatally ill. elspeth is in hospital on life support, and oliver is there recounting all his actions. he reveals he had been responsible for all the tragedies that took place at saltburn. oliver deliberately punctured felix's bike tyre in order to meet him, he poisoned felix in the hedge maze after final rejection, he subtly manipulated venetia into cutting and killing herself, and he fabricated the email that led to farleigh leaving the estate. finally, it is revealed that he planned his reacquaintance with elspeth and that she subsequently left all the financial assets to him, including ownership of saltburn. after all his confessions, oliver forcefully removes the tube supplying oxygen for elspeth, killing her. now officially the owner of saltburn and the catton fortune, oliver dances naked around the mansion to ""murder on the dancefloor"" by sophie ellis-bextor, and the death stones with all family names are displayed on a sideboard. also starring paul rhys as duncan the butler, reece shearsmith as professor ware, lolly adefope as lady daphne, sadie soverall as annabel, and millie kent as india. keoghan is compelling as the awkward young man who lingers in the mansion, elordi plays the charming obnoxious rich boy well, pike steals all her scenes with her great one-liners, grant is reliable as always, madekwe is good at being hateful, and mulligan's cameo is welcome. what starts as a crush and wanting to fit in with the rich people goes in a dark direction you don't expect, it follows a familiar format where the wealthy eccentric characters are all unlikeable, it is funny when it needs to be, amusingly cringey and uncomfortable in moments, and the twists work relatively well, and the final scene and song choice is genius, it is certainly a memorable and worthwhile black comedy psychological thriller. very good!"

","if it wasn't already obvious in the first film, it's now officially clear as day that the people behind the spider-verse franchise (including writers/producers phil lord and chris miller, who are absolute creative godsends to the once magnificent place known as hollywood) understand exactly what they're working with.don't let the marketing fool you: this film has guts. it's easily one of the heaviest pg-rated films i've ever seen. payoffs and character revelations that were only hinted at in the first film are carefully, deliberately unraveled and come around beautifully. it made me think about my own life and what i mean to the people i care about in ways i never expected. the fan-service is batty too, and yet somehow it's never too much.i wish every movie was as good as this---but then again if the world was like that this wouldn't feel as special. so i'll just stick to being immensely grateful that it exists in this universe.this is no ordinary sequel. it's art of the highest form."

","first off, you should know that this is the first part of one big movie split into two, harry potter style. except, everyone in the theater went nuts when it ended, i guess because it doesn't have ""part one"" in the title. it doesn't really stand on its own, as far as the story goes. so it's kind of hard to rate it, since it set up way more than it concluded. can't wait to see the next one.anyway, even as just one half of a two-parter, this movie is awesome. if you thought you liked the style of ""into the spider-verse"", then you got another thing coming. this movie is so much more than that, it's crazy, and it does not disappoint. boggles the mind how this much stuff can even be animated at all.the visuals have got to be seen to be believed. every scene has so much going on, and you could even say each scene has its own art style. it goes way beyond what the first movie did, and that was already crazy. the blending of styles on its own makes this a one of a kind movie, that will be hard to replicate. i'm even sort of mad that this creative energy hadn't been released before, because we are getting some insane stuff nowadays.one small complaint i do have is that all this, combined with the very fast action can make it a bit hard to breathe sometimes. honestly i can't take too many points off for that though.the soudtrack is great, i can't wait for it to release. there truly are some bangers in there, and most of them are actually the score of the movie, not licensed music.and the story is awesome as well, although again it's hard to judge before seeing the next one. there's a lot more going on than in the first one, and most this movie explores the character of gwen more and it's awesome. it's still about miles though, and that part is also cool. i loved the spot.so yeah i could say more, but i think you should just go see it. this might end up as one of the best trilogies of all time."

","let me just say that the first hour of this film had me hooked and i just knew this film surpass it's predecessor in terms of the story & entertainment. around the 2 hour mark i started wondering when or if there would be a climax? various scenes felt like they were dragging on for way too long. we really didn't need all the scenes of peter b. parker and his child. for me personally i felt like there was no build up or anticipation due to how long certain scenes played out. then the film ended on a cliffhanger and then i understood, this film is a middle movie, a gateway between the first film and the next film and unfortunately it showed. they didn't have a definitive ending for this film which is fine but at some point the scenes just felt like filler. i believe it is still a movie worth seeing, however, it falls short of the first movie in terms of keeping my attention."

"610","spiderman","jaywolfgramm",2023-06-11,7," wanted to love it, but just liked it
","i absolutely loved 2018's ""into the spider-verse"". it not only earned its ""best animated picture"" oscar, not only was it the best spider-man movie, but it stands as a landmark in animation. it set the record for most animators working on a single film. that record was then broken by this sequel. with five years of anticipation, and with the talented hands of lord and miller behind the scenes i was super hyped for this movie. i was prepped to love this film. i had heard nothing but good things, and all its praise is well deserved. but i couldn't help but walk away just saying the film was...good.given the film's stellar reception, i feel compelled to explain why i only am giving this film a respectable 7. first off, this film is not a complete story. it is a ""part 1"" and ends on a ""to be continued..."". i don't think that's a spoiler considering the original teaser advertised it as ""across the spider-verse: part 1"". but like the great cliff hangers of the past, like ""two towers"", ""empire strikes back"" or ""back to the future part 2"", the movie needs to complete some self-contained conflict. this film does not complete a conflict. there is no feeling of resolution. i feel my full review is currently being held hostage from the fact that the story is incomplete. i can't give this full marks considering the story could end like the series ""lost"" and completely undermined the whole journey.with that out of the way, i can tell you all the things that makes this movie great. the animation is a step up even from the previous groundbreaking entry. there are so many different animation styles that the team juggles, and it they all looked visually stunning. for some it may be over stimulation, but i thought it moved at just the right speed.the ""fan service"", ""easter eggs"" or whatever you want to call them, are never overused. there are some movies that treat the easter eggs like they are the main course, this movie balances them well. they never overstay their welcome and always add to the story as opposed to distract from it.the humor is spot on. there are so many jokes in this movie that had me laughing awkwardly loud. the jokes don't have the typical mcu problem of detracting from a serious moment, those are given the time to breath. but the jokes are fast paced, witty and come from a variety of sources. there are visual gags, character jokes, situational jokes and it isn't all reliant on a single person for their humor.and the action in this movie, it is next level stuff. every fight scene or chase scene is like the bridge fight in ""kung fu panda"". the movement is fluid, the detail is superb, and everything falls in just the right place. it is poetry in motion, since they are spider-men doing the action, all the acrobatics and reflexes work well within the story. it is a reminder of what makes this character so much fun to write for.there are 2 main conflicts that pop up in the story, both feeding into the same narrative theme. when the second comes into focus, that is where the movie loses some momentum. it is nice for story reasons in that our hero feels completely alone. the problem is it raises a lot of questions that might get answered in later movies, but for now are ignored. on the positive side, just when i think i have the film figured out, it throws one last hook at me, and absolutely has me hooked for the next one.who knows, maybe one day when the trilogy is completed, i will come back and amend my review. but as it stands right now, i can't give it anything higher than what i gave it. don't let me down third movie, with great power, comes great responsibility."
"611","spiderman","planktonrules",2023-06-21,4," perhaps not for everyone.
","""spider-man: across the spider-verse"" currently has an astounding overall rating of 9.0. like many other incredibly high ranked movies, i'm sure over time the score will drop but given it's so high now, i cannot imagine it leveling off below 8.0...meaning it's one of the best rated movies of all time. well, while it might be a great crowd-pleaser, i am writing a dissenting review....and if you are like me, you might not be as bowled over as most reviewers.to put things in perspective, i am 59 years-old and certainly not in the target audience....so keep this in mind. while i like an occasional superhero film, i also don't adore them...but i did think the previous spider-man film, ""spider-man: into the spiderverse"" was one of the best of its genre. in fact, i gave it a 10...i was that impressed with its originality and story and animation. so why was i left colder by its sequel? well, there are several reasons. first, if you are like me and not all that familiar with spider-man, you'll probably find much of the story confusing...unlike the previous film. second, the artwork, while very original, made my brain hurt! it was loud and brash and really awful...at least to me. the worst part was that the backgrounds actually looked like i was watching a 3-d movie without 3-d glasses! uggh...it was an assault on my eyes. and, third, i hated how the film ended with no plot resolution whatsoever....none.so does all this mean i hated the film? no. i laughed quite a few times...and mostly when it introduced other alternate universe spider-creatures (many are women or animals...not just spider-men). i also thought the basic story, once you strip away the horribly fast edits and garish artwork, was very interesting. overall, not a bad film but i just did not particularly enjoy it nor do i particularly need to see the third and final film in the series."
"612","spiderman","rgkarim",2023-06-02,9," across the universe of fun, excellence, and adventure: spider-man makes a connected web of wow
","likes:the pace for the most part
-comic book movies are an art that requires balance to tell all it has to tell, and miles' next story.. has a lot to tell.-it found a good pace for me to tell the story, giving you the character development, but not at a pace that was too slow and lost on itself, for the most part.-yet, the movie did manage to keep it slow enough that there was real development, build up, hints, and appreciation to age like fine wine.-this dynamic was very impressive to me, keeping an engaging movie for my attention, but not skimping out on the action like some of these deeper movies try to do.-that takes talent in the cooking pot as big as this, building on the past movie, but yet doing its own thing until the end for the setup.the voice acting
-everyone rocks in this movie, and i have to agree with my friend that it is grade a on many levels with what you get in live action movies.-isaac is still strong as the anti-hero role that he often plays. his moodiness, his anger, his dark edge are mirrored in the character. there is hurt, anguish, and the fire that he shows so well, and i love how his voice is the main focus in his performance and not the looks.-hailee steinfeld is fantastic in gwen. it's like taking all of her characters from her movie and integrating a piece of them into this gwen and expanding her far into a character i really liked.-she was vulnerable and strong, a realistic character whose performance came out in spades and fully awakened the character i think they were going for.-and moore... well moore is just freaking amazing as morales. that tone, vulnerability, this maturity but still immaturity cascading and once more evolving a character from the first one being believable. a stellar performance and one that i think brought so many things together, engaging with each of the others into this dynamic role.-it all works so well and i loved the strong talent bringing things to life.the storytelling
-there are so many who say that comic movies seldom tell a good story or are telling the same story over and over again. and to a degree... they are right.-yet... for across the spider-verse, that story feels fresh, engaging, and grounded to a degree that helps balance reality and super heroism into a great mashup.-it's not so in your face super adventures that are all about action, violence, and cgi madness, but it also isn't cw bologna about exploring our feelings in colorful underwear.-this sequel really focuses so much on building up characters, but integrating it into this main comic adventure that works to keep both involved and feel like a superhero.-i love the heart into it, and the way they built up from the first movie, but yet made this movie its own thing, until the final moments where the known cliffhanger was going to come in.-and to add relative components to it, engaging characters, and keeping those characters involved in the story... that is tough work.the comedy to a degree
-i really enjoyed the diverse comedy in this movie, and how many types of jokes and styles that were in it.-miles is sort of a jack of all trades, sarcasm, banter, slapstick, he has a little bit of everything in it and i love it.-others are just rambling idiots who are throwing so many jokes and statements that some eventually hit, but you have to listen because they fluctuate in terms of volume and such.-and other jokes are so well-timed and loaded with sarcasm that you just appreciate the laugh from the time alone.-it has it all and in relative balance to keep things fresh and not overwhelmingly stale as they hope from one joke to the other.the nostalgia and easter eggs
-part of that comedy comes in the references loaded into this movie almost as much as the plot in this movie, and it works.-across the spider-verse, tackles many famous tropes in both spiderman comics and movies, blending the two of them together into this natural flowing arc that utilizes it well.-nostalgia reigns supreme in this movie, all the comic and show references of the webbed wonder just taking my child nature and taking it for the roller coaster ride of finding everything i could.-but the movie references as well... so much fun as well, seeing these micro moments and nods to the other universes and watching them blended into the comedy and story.-then to have it just in the world, it's going to make for a fun rewatch potential in the future.the action scenes
-a huge step up, across the spider-verse took my dislike from the first film and unleashed much more of the action i knew it had.-the opening scene paints for some great things to come, but soon the fight scenes and adventure transform into something that is fun, exciting, and family friendly.-chase scenes have energy, with styles that flow and show off the heart of the animation, feels of the comic book and fan art coming together into this cascade of color and energy.-i loved the way that they evolved past punches and added more emotions and stakes that though predictable still held glimmer of exciting twists if they come.-and the fact they can punch, kick, and slam without being bloody messes should please so many, alongside the fact that the action all goes in line with the actual plot.the animation/art style
-you've seen the trailers and the first one and know how beautiful the movie is. amidst the blurry backgrounds, the movie really has bold art direction that captures comic book spirit.-the computer animation goes well with the natural feel of the art, and i loved the way it felt like flipping through a flip book and seeing it come to life.-it respects both worlds so well, and like the story keeps things easy to follow and discover to appreciate everything the spider-verse had to offer. that was epic.-and to keep all that in relatively stable camera work, something the first movie struggled with, shows how you can really continue to improve if you take the time and think things through.dislikes:the comedy a bit too forced
-there are times where the humor is a bit forced for me, primarily in the moments where they just spout joke after joke after joke to the point where things get lost.-these moments are few and far between for me, but there are times where a character gets annoying over funny.some pacing offsets
-there are times where the movie trips up on the pace for me. a few moments where the conversations are dragged out or we get a tad touchy feeling and not enough of seeing what's going on.-this happened about the first hour or so for me, but once that part passes most of the movie establishes the pace i talked about for much of the movie.-at least until the need.the ending 20 minutes for me
-the ending 20 minutes felt very dragged out as it set up the cliffhanger we knew was coming the moment it said part 1 long ago.-the ending is very drawn out, you know the movie is over, and you know what is coming, but it uses the art to drag it out, bloating the movie for the twenty minutes that could have been in the next movie.-fortunately one of the final moments adds that fantastic bridge with music, shots, and feels that work, but still... we could have cut a few things out.-and fortunately there are no end credits, which there does not need to be.the sound quality with some characters
-it might have been my theater, but some of the characters mumble and talk fast meaning... it's hard to hear them.-spider-punk has some of the best lines, but they get drowned out by background noise, mumbling speakers, and sound inconsistencies.-this leads to missing several things and taking away from the character that seems so cool, and this happens to several other characters when there is so much noise. as such, those moments are annoying to me, but again could be theater dependents.the verdict:
overall, the praise is worthy to across the spider-verse, and i was very happy with much of the film that they brought to life to this theater. it's a sequel that does things right, taking the first movie's foundations and bringing with it something to build up and enjoy to the full extent. that bold and beautiful art has been refined to near perfection, and does so much storytelling alone that it's almost enough to go see it just for that in theater. but the movie integrates story, morals, comedy, nostalgia, and action to a degree that really feels like some of the strongest storytelling in a superhero movie. i love the authentic feel of a superhero story, and i love the passion of balancing so much in a movie without every losing track of the story to tell. sure there were pacing issues and some sound flops for me, but that's really minor when it comes to the movie overall and everything they did to make this movie the middle of the trilogy, but still stand on its own. you can obviously guess i'm recommending this for the theater, and yes families can see it as there aren't too much dark moments. and my scores for those who need it are:animation/action/adventure: 9.0-9.5
movie overall: 8.5."

(during gwen's 20 minute opening.) by the time the film picked up its pace and stakes (the last 30 minutes) i was already mentally checking out, watching the time and waiting for it to end. and yes, basically nothing is resolved by the end of it, if you're wondering. multiple people in my theater were groaning as the credits began rolling, due to the cliffhanger. scenes stretched on far too long, had repetitive dialogue and just set up the final movie. i truly don't see the hype about this one. i think the wrap up next year will be good, i have seen films do a better job in a trilogy of making the second movie mean something. i feel harsh saying this, as the animation, soundtrack and characters are awesome! i just feel like people are acting like this is the best animated movie to be released, but it's just not. it doesn't live up to the greatness of it's predecessor. hopefully the finale next year will make it all worth it!"

","saltburn is a story about oliver, portrayed by barry keoghan(love him, who doesn't? i've seen killing of a sacred deer at least 10 times).his infatuation with felix catton, which starts at oxford, quickly spirals into an obsession, leading to some morally ambiguous, if not outright disturbing, choices. what starts as a seemingly innocent attraction, soon morphs into something dark and uncontrollable.what struck me most about saltburn is its clever use of greek mythology as a narrative tool. the parallels drawn between oliver's actions and the story of theseus and the minotaur add a rich layer of symbolism. this mythological reference isn't just a backdrop; it's integral to understanding oliver's character and his journey.the film also delves into the themes of social class and the dichotomy between public persona and private reality. in an age where social media often dictates how we present ourselves to the world, 'saltburn' offers a critical, if not cynical, view of this duality. oliver's character becomes a vessel for exploring these themes, making us question the authenticity of those around us.director emerald fennell doesn't shy away from making bold choices in 'saltburn,' particularly in how the story unfolds. some may find the film's progression and its eventual climax a bit jarring, but i believe it adds to the film's uniqueness. the narrative isn't straightforward, and it's this complexity that makes 'saltburn' stand out.the performances in the film are noteworthy. barry keoghan delivers a nuanced portrayal of oliver, balancing vulnerability with an underlying sense of menace. the supporting cast, including jacob elordi and rosamund pike, also contribute significantly to the film's overall impact. i've been skeptical of them, but i was impressed.in conclusion, saltburn is a thought-provoking film that challenges conventional storytelling. it's a blend of mythology and modernity, a narrative that forces us to confront the darker aspects of desire and ambition. while it may not be everyone's cup of tea (i was grossed out by two scenes, you know the ones), for those who appreciate a film that makes you think and re-evaluate, saltburn is definitely worth a watch. i've been skeptical of them, but i was impressed."

","it doesn't take long to realist that there is nothing particularly original in the plot of this movie. more or less from the outset it promises to be a more debauched, british version of the talented mr ripley, and ultimately it never strays too far from that tag.having thus tempered expectations, there is enough in the first hour or so of this film to offer some encouragement that the film could at least be watchable.our protagonist oliver (barry keoghan) is a scholarship boy at oxford. initially ostracised from the in-crowd by his lack of wealth or social grace, he works his way into the orbit of the charming, dashing and rich felix (jacob elordi), and is ultimately invited to the titular family home. there he is introduced to the bizarre world of the british aristocracy and the idiosyncratic characters that populate it.having established this fish-out-of-water narrative, and despite the sterling efforts of its cast, the plot then begins to drift. we are offered glimpses of what might have been - the relationship between oliver and felix's sister venetia (alison oliver), in particular, briefly offers opportunity for real interest and intrigue - but the film eschews these in favour of a far more well-worn and unchallenging path.as a consequence, the second half of the film - which is written to be rich in twists, reveals and shocks - becomes bland, predictable and - frankly - boring.there are strong performances throughout the film - rosamund pike, as felix's mother, is particularly engaging and amusing, and attempts admirably to carry much of the second half of the film. jacob elordi, though slightly unconvincing as a british aristocrat, looks nevertheless to have a bright future ahead of him. richard e. grant, as felix's father, is good value as well, even if his character is a little one-dimensional.and there are interesting characters who are never properly explored. pamela (carey mulligan) is a guest at saltburn who has overstayed her welcome, but is discarded as swiftly as she is introduced. farleigh (archie madekwe) is oliver's rival for felix's attention and funding, and provides a character that is well-drawn, well-performed and interesting, but again disappears from view in the latter stages of the film. this is particularly disappointing as archie madekwe does a great job of balancing his character's contradictions: intellectual but belligerent, confident but desperate, charming but hostile.the final result has some strong moments and some good performances, but ultimately fails to develop into a worthy film. at 2 hours and 7 minutes in length, it feels at least half an hour too long, and i confess it was ultimately a relief to finally be able to leave the cinema."

","greetings again from the darkness. emerald fennell won an oscar for her original screenplay of her dark and divisive debut feature film, promising young woman (2020). she's back as writer-director of her second feature film, and it's every bit as dark, and even more scathing in its takedown of the rich and entitled. we are also treated to yet another awkwardly disturbed character for the growing resume of barry keoghan.oliver quick (keoghan) is a newly arrived student of the class of 2006 at oxford, and it's clear from the first moment that he doesn't really fit in, whether it's his clothes, not smoking, his uneasiness with his tutor, or his social ineptness. he becomes transfixed on the bmoc, felix catton (jacob elordi, fresh off his turn as elvis in priscilla). felix is tall, handsome, charming, and rich. life comes easy for him, and students are drawn to him - both male and female. he's a modern-day aristocrat, and one day oliver helps him out of a jam. this leads to a bonding, or more like worlds colliding. the first act is devoted to the development of this unexpected friendship, and leads to felix inviting oliver to spend the summer at his family estate ... saltburn.saltburn is nothing short of a magnificent castle. felix's eccentric family includes farleigh (archie madekwe, gran turismo), an adopted ""cousin"" fellow oxfor student who sees all but would never blow this gig; venetia (alison oliver), the total mess of a daughter and sister; poor dear pamela (carey mulligan), the total mess of a houseguest who has overstayed her welcome; sir james catton (richard e grant), the childlike father; and espeth catton (rosamund pike), the former model drama queen passive-aggressive mother. it's a motley crew that puts 'the royal tenenbaums' to shame for entitlement.as the summer progresses, we see oliver in action as he weasels his way into the good graces of some, while creating leverage over others. his non-descript looks, quiet demeanor, and background story lead some to protect him at the same time others distrust him. as viewers, it's obvious to us that something isn't right with oliver, yet director fennell and keoghan's performance keeps us hopeful that things won't become too skewed. those hopes are dashed once we see keoghan's first bathtub scene (and subsequent disturbing moments), and fennell serves up multiple references to his mouth in letting us know it's not to be trusted.the third act goes full dark in a deliciously wicked manner with fennell and oscar winning cinematographer linus sandgren (la la land) creating an old world style within a contemporary world. the film is perfectly cast with elordi quite magnetic as felix, the not-so-obscure object of oliver's desire. madekwe is spot on as the turf-protecting farleigh, and grant and pike make the perfectly mismatched couple of privilege. alison oliver delivers the film's best scene with her bathtub monologue, while keoghan nails the creepy oliver (in line with his roles in the banshees of inisherin, the killing of a sacred deer, and the batman. he has become the go-to psychopath. he even combines humor and horror for his happy naked castle dance in this film that has the talented mr ripley (1999) as its most obvious comparison. ms. fennell strikes another blow against the entitled elite, although we do wish she hadn't spelled out everything to end the film ... a bit of mystique would have worked.opening in theaters on november 22, 2023."

","fennell's previous film, ""promising young woman,"" was a hate fantasy about wreaking vengeance on a bunch of abusive guys (and one woman administrator) responsible for the death of the heroine's friend. as happens in such fantasies (and only in such fantasies), every step of her plan went way too smoothly; the avenging heroine easily tricked all the men -- reducing them, one by one, to contrite weeping wimps -- and humiliated the woman administrator, leaving her crushed.the hate fantasy in this new film succeeds with even more implausible ease. a homely, inarticulate, lumpish nerd at oxford is -- implausibly -- befriended by a tall, handsome, immensely wealthy fellow student who takes him home to his lavish, implausibly underpopulated country estate the size of buckingham palace, where his aristocrat family lives with what appears to be a single butler and two footmen (except at one point near the end, where a gaggle of servants we've never seen before suddenly appear). this family -- implausibly sappy, since the success of the comic-book plot depends on their being a bunch of absolute patsies -- takes the lumpish young visitor to its bosom, lavishing upon him a totally unbelievable degree of attention and affection.... whereupon, halfway through the movie, the inarticulate young visitor is suddenly revealed to be a smooth-talking, machiavellian, diabolical psychopath who neatly -- did i mention implausibly? -- murders the family members, one by one, and in the end inherits the estate.so basically, the movie starts out as ""brideshead revisited,"" only cruder and ickier, and midway through turns into ""the omen,"" only dumber.there's one original surprise involving the young man's return home. i didn't even recognize the wonderful actress dorothy atkinson as his mother. and archie madekwe is all too believable as the sort of arrogant, racially privileged type we don't often see depicted in today's media."

","i'm in utter shock at how good saltburn turned out to be. i was looking forward to it but i didn't expect to be top 5 of the year (maybe even top 10 of the decade) for me. that's only because i really liked promising young woman but i wasn't totally blown away by it. it had so many great concepts and moments but some of the execution was a bit lacking for me. but i can confidently say emerald fennell elevated her craft in every single way for her second movie.this script is almost completely air tight. i was intrigued from almost the first frame and it never let me go from there. fennell's been very open about the influence of the talent mr ripley on this film and it's very apparent but she absolutely does her own thing with it. it doesn't always feel like it's going in a specific direction but i was always excited to see where it was going.this character, played perfectly in what i think is barry keoghan's best performance, is so interesting and i never quite knew how to feel about him in all the best ways. fennell builds up his connection with jacob elordi so well and there's such a specific chemistry between the 2 of them that was riveting to watch and they took elrodi's character in a direction i didn't expect but absolutely loved.i won't go as far as to say that i didn't predict any of the twists or turns. there were some reveals that i did see coming but it all comes down to execution and every single beat and plot revelation of this script felt earned from a character perspective and took everything to a satisfying conclusion. i've already mentioned the mr ripley inspiration but there's a little knives out in there, some illusions to parasite, hints to get out and even the shining.that's not to say fennell is being derivative here because this film absolutely feels like her vision through and through and it's so impressive just how many tones she managed to blend seamlessly. my only real issue with the script, and really the film overall, is fennell's need to occasionally over explain things. there's a lot of backstory to these characters but the means in which she delivers the exposition around them can feel forced and like the scene just has to stop to fill in their history. certain scenes towards the end makes these moments more understandable in retrospect but it still felt clunky in the moment.the technical prowess on display was astounding. based off the trailers, i wasn't sure if i was going to like the unique aspect ratio this film employs but it ended up working perfectly for me. it gave a sense of intimacy to everything and it let me get more immersed into the character interactions and even the broader landscape shots as well. the camerawork fennell pulls of here is insane, there are so many impressive one takes and it has without a doubt one of the most unique final shots i've seen in a movie in a long time. the cinematography is also jaw dropping, it's roger deakins level stuff for me and it honestly made my jaw drop more than once. if it doesn't get nominated for, let alone win, the oscar i'll be outraged.saltburn is such an experience of a movie that i can't help but in awe of what emerald fennell pulled off. it's constantly intriguing, tension filled and investing despite the truly horrible acts done by the characters. it's visually stunning with some of the best performances i've seen from most of these actors. it hasn't left my mind in the day since i saw it and it just feels like the kind of movie we don't see enough of. amazon are absolutely killing it this year with air and now this and they need to keep putting these kinds of movies in theatres. after this, i can't wait to see what emerald fennell does next because if she puts out another film of this quality she'll be well on her way to being one of the best directors working right now."

","discussed on all social networks, emerald fennell's film ""saltburn"" hooks you from the first minute. the first frames immediately immerse us inside the head of the main character oliver, and do not let us go until the very end.the plot of the film revolves around oliver and felix, who study at oxford. oliver is a shy guy who can't make friends in a new place. but he finds the strength to meet felix. with their acquaintance, their rapprochement into best friends begins.the acting performance of barry keoghan, who played oliver, undeservedly went unnoticed by the film academy. from film to film, barry proves to everyone that he is a great actor, but this film was his peak. he was paired with jacob elordi (felix), familiar to us from the tv series euphoria, who is slowly getting closer to leading roles in films. together with barry, they have great chemistry on camera, and the relationship they develop is interesting to watch.the film was shot in a 4:3 format, unusual for modern times, which at first glance may discourage you from watching the film. but after the first part of the film, every frame justifies the format chosen by the director. the frame, which is narrowed on the sides, makes the characters even closer and the atmosphere more personal, as if the photograph has its own story behind it.emotionally, the film will not leave you indifferent. watching can be compared to a roller coaster. at first we are immersed in one genre, but by the end of the film we find ourselves in a completely different one.overall, this is a film that will keep you engaged. a captivating plot and outstanding acting will make watching ""saltburn"" an unforgettable cinematic experience."

"679","spiderman","cdjh-81125",2023-11-19,9," an outstanding achievement and a massive step up for emerald fennell
","i'm in utter shock at how good saltburn turned out to be. i was looking forward to it but i didn't expect to be top 5 of the year (maybe even top 10 of the decade) for me. that's only because i really liked promising young woman but i wasn't totally blown away by it. it had so many great concepts and moments but some of the execution was a bit lacking for me. but i can confidently say emerald fennell elevated her craft in every single way for her second movie.this script is almost completely air tight. i was intrigued from almost the first frame and it never let me go from there. fennell's been very open about the influence of the talent mr ripley on this film and it's very apparent but she absolutely does her own thing with it. it doesn't always feel like it's going in a specific direction but i was always excited to see where it was going.this character, played perfectly in what i think is barry keoghan's best performance, is so interesting and i never quite knew how to feel about him in all the best ways. fennell builds up his connection with jacob elordi so well and there's such a specific chemistry between the 2 of them that was riveting to watch and they took elrodi's character in a direction i didn't expect but absolutely loved.i won't go as far as to say that i didn't predict any of the twists or turns. there were some reveals that i did see coming but it all comes down to execution and every single beat and plot revelation of this script felt earned from a character perspective and took everything to a satisfying conclusion. i've already mentioned the mr ripley inspiration but there's a little knives out in there, some illusions to parasite, hints to get out and even the shining.that's not to say fennell is being derivative here because this film absolutely feels like her vision through and through and it's so impressive just how many tones she managed to blend seamlessly. my only real issue with the script, and really the film overall, is fennell's need to occasionally over explain things. there's a lot of backstory to these characters but the means in which she delivers the exposition around them can feel forced and like the scene just has to stop to fill in their history. certain scenes towards the end makes these moments more understandable in retrospect but it still felt clunky in the moment.the technical prowess on display was astounding. based off the trailers, i wasn't sure if i was going to like the unique aspect ratio this film employs but it ended up working perfectly for me. it gave a sense of intimacy to everything and it let me get more immersed into the character interactions and even the broader landscape shots as well. the camerawork fennell pulls of here is insane, there are so many impressive one takes and it has without a doubt one of the most unique final shots i've seen in a movie in a long time. the cinematography is also jaw dropping, it's roger deakins level stuff for me and it honestly made my jaw drop more than once. if it doesn't get nominated for, let alone win, the oscar i'll be outraged.saltburn is such an experience of a movie that i can't help but in awe of what emerald fennell pulled off. it's constantly intriguing, tension filled and investing despite the truly horrible acts done by the characters. it's visually stunning with some of the best performances i've seen from most of these actors. it hasn't left my mind in the day since i saw it and it just feels like the kind of movie we don't see enough of. amazon are absolutely killing it this year with air and now this and they need to keep putting these kinds of movies in theatres. after this, i can't wait to see what emerald fennell does next because if she puts out another film of this quality she'll be well on her way to being one of the best directors working right now."

","oliver, a seemingly working-class oxford student, falls in with a group of upper-class kids, one of whom invites him to his huge old stately home (saltburn) and may be an object of obsession for him. oliver is thus, or roughly thus, led into elaborate lies and worse. my uncertainties here are because the plot is never really clear.it's probably not a deliberate irony that the film often appears to want to be the talented mr. ripley, possibly the greatest story ever about wanting to be someone else. unfortunately, it also apes, by turns, brideshead revisited, the servant and the little stranger. these impulses are not compatible and all said precursors are vastly superior.the script's one real strength lies in the area where writer-director emerald fennel was, presumably, able to write what she knows not from other people's art but her own experience: an upper-class british person herself, her depictions of upper-class british people are mercilessly perfect, ably abetted by very funny performances from richard e. grant and, especially, rosamund pike.but that accounts for about five minutes in an otherwise quite astonishingly amateurish mess. oliver is either the sad sexual obsessive of ripley or the single-mindedly sociopathic revanchist class warrior of the servant. the two do not go together; the only real guiding principle seems to be whatever transgressive, would-be shocking image fennel wants to show us. furthermore, in class warrior guise, oliver is supposed to be carrying out an elaborate, precisely calibrated, 5d chess stratagem that in reality depends on absurdly impossible luck and the fog-brained gullibility of everyone else concerned.this review is a rewrite. fennel should, at best, have done more of those herself. her film's grainy, grimy, fashion-shoot prettiness, which seduced me a little at first - hence the rewrite - has soured over time like perfume used to cover up the smell of putrefying corpses. it's bad enough that fennel has written characters stupid enough to be duped by such transparent ruses. it's wqrse that she seems to expect this of her viewers too - and perhaps even a little worse yet that some of them, on the evidence of these reviews, have fallen in line."

","evidently the jinx of the ""sophomore slump"" held no claim over emerald fennell, britain's new filmmaking auteur and cinematic wunderkind. in only her second movie, the popular writer-director has already soared past expectations, delivering a film which not only far surpasses the success of her debut promising young woman (which was excellent), but which succeeds so well in all its ambitions that it just might belong in the conversation for genre classic. it certainly ranks quite high among my personal favorites for films of its kind.in my opinion, saltburn is a masterpiece. a purely singular, cinematic tour-de-force, with an abundance of style, all put to use in service of a story that is both attractive and engrossing, while never ceasing to be entertaining. it's the kind of film that sears itself in your memory with its brazenness-to say nothing of the level of prurience that permeates some of the more salacious/depraved bits. i know that sounds like it could be a negative, but believe me, it definitely works in this film's favor; keeping the tone both erotically charged as well as deeply unsettling. in fact, the whole film is astoundingly well-balanced, maintaining a sly confidence in itself which makes it all the more entrancing despite (because of?) it taking things to such extremes. occasionally you might feel like recoiling, but you'll remain unable to look away.since the film only released wide several weeks ago, i'll refrain from saying much about plot specifics in this review (nothing beyond superficial comparison anyway), as i'd hate to spoil anyone from having the same incredible experience i had going in blind. this is an opportunity that hopefully most people will be afforded, owing to the stellar marketing for the film which somehow managed to build intrigue without revealing hardly anything about the story (take note studio heads, this is how it should be done!). it's an especially blessed achievement in this case, as this is a film with a deviously good script and it'd be a shame to miss out on its myriad surprises.additionally, with saltburn, emerald fennell has not only gifted us fans of crime/mystery stories with a modern genre masterpiece, she has also given us the best ripley movie without tom ripley. indeed, the film evokes a superlative, verging on definitive, homage to the famous amoral hedonist with a knack for escaping consequences, and i would honestly be shocked to find out fennell wasn't a highsmith fan. at times this script feels almost like a re-imagining of the talented mr. ripley for the millennial generation; albeit one cleverly tailored to the sensibilities and sexual fluidity of the euphoria crowd. the use of hyper-stylized cinematography, as well as the film's decidedly ""in vogue"" choice of music, also evoke the style of that series to a degree. that said, jacob elordi playing against type as the rich aristocrat felix catton (ostensibly a spoiled playboy, but whose surprising sensitive side may reveal him to be an actual decent person) subverts those expectations in the best way.whatever the reality behind her inspiration, this film is in no way a mere imitation of another work. instead, fennell more than proves her mettle as a writer/director capable of executing her unique ideas with extreme precision. frankly, she couldn't seem more at home in the genre, and despite a concept that on the surface may appear to be aiming at mere homage, fennell spares no time proving that notion false; taking a deceptively original approach to a tried and true theme, and running with it to intoxicating effect.saltburn is an utterly enthralling mystery, with an impressively sustained blend of familiarity and unpredictability. the script is brimming with witty dialogue, wickedly dark humor, compelling social commentary on class division, and no shortage of clever twists. all in all, this makes for a fiercely captivating affair from start to finish. so much so, in fact, that when the many disparate threads finally start to come together in the final act, the result is harrowing and nothing short of extraordinary!this is filmmaking of the highest order from someone who is quickly becoming one of the most interesting artists working today. if it wasn't such a crowded year i would say fennell was a shoe-in for another best original screenplay nom. although then again, when considering the uncomfortable nature of certain moments in the film, it may be a stretch to think the academy is ready to vote for something this far out. i hope they're not all too close-minded to recognize fennell's talent though, and this at least ends up getting some (well-deserved) awards attention. in any case, if she's able to keep up the momentum then her work will soon be impossible to ignore, no matter how dark/insane she decides to go with her next project. personally, i'd love to see her re-team with keoghan/mulligan and try her hand at a full-on horror flick!anyways, beyond the film's critical reception, what perhaps will be most interesting is seeing the overall response it gets from general audiences. i'd imagine they won't be expecting just how shocking certain aspects of the story are, and all those forming their expectations based on her first film (like i did) are likely to be caught off guard by a handful of these scenes (if not outright turned off). the film never felt in any way exploitative or pretentious to me though. on the contrary, i felt like the balance and tone that it struck were basically flawless. even if a small number of viewers do find it too offensive, that will probably just add to the allure of the film. ultimately, the purity of conviction shown by the creative team in taking things as far as they did clearly panned out.suffice it to say, i've never seen anything quite like this film, and i was completely blown away. in fact, for me, it rather handily beats out oppenheimer, beau is afraid, and killers of the flower moon as the best of the year, and i'd go so far as to call it a film destined to be discussed, analyzed, argued over, and admired by cinephiles of every kind for years to come.finally, i'd be remiss not to mention the film's true oscar potential, and that's barry keoghan. his raw performance as the socially awkward, yet smart and deeply enigmatic loner oliver quick is so brilliantly nuanced, mysterious, and disturbing that i can all but guarantee it will ""make your blood run cold."" barry is absolutely the underdog to look out for come award season, and this film proves, decisively, that he was the perfect choice to take up the mantle of the joker.rating: 9.5/10.....edited to add - i can't believe i forgot to praise the incredible use of ""murder on the dance floor"" in one of the film's final montages. i've been waiting forever for someone to re-tap the potential of the song, and its use here might be the best of any hit since the pixies' ""where is my mind?"" swelled up at the end of fight club."

","evidently the jinx of the ""sophomore slump"" held no claim over emerald fennell, britain's new filmmaking auteur and cinematic wunderkind. in only her second movie, the popular writer-director has already soared past expectations, delivering a film which not only far surpasses the success of her debut promising young woman (which was excellent), but which succeeds so well in all its ambitions that it just might belong in the conversation for genre classic. it certainly ranks quite high among my personal favorites for films of its kind.in my opinion, saltburn is a masterpiece. a purely singular, cinematic tour-de-force, with an abundance of style, all put to use in service of a story that is both attractive and engrossing, while never ceasing to be entertaining. it's the kind of film that sears itself in your memory with its brazenness-to say nothing of the level of prurience that permeates some of the more salacious/depraved bits. i know that sounds like it could be a negative, but believe me, it definitely works in this film's favor; keeping the tone both erotically charged as well as deeply unsettling. in fact, the whole film is astoundingly well-balanced, maintaining a sly confidence in itself which makes it all the more entrancing despite (because of?) it taking things to such extremes. occasionally you might feel like recoiling, but you'll remain unable to look away.since the film only released wide several weeks ago, i'll refrain from saying much about plot specifics in this review (nothing beyond superficial comparison anyway), as i'd hate to spoil anyone from having the same incredible experience i had going in blind. this is an opportunity that hopefully most people will be afforded, owing to the stellar marketing for the film which somehow managed to build intrigue without revealing hardly anything about the story (take note studio heads, this is how it should be done!). it's an especially blessed achievement in this case, as this is a film with a deviously good script and it'd be a shame to miss out on its myriad surprises.additionally, with saltburn, emerald fennell has not only gifted us fans of crime/mystery stories with a modern genre masterpiece, she has also given us the best ripley movie without tom ripley. indeed, the film evokes a superlative, verging on definitive, homage to the famous amoral hedonist with a knack for escaping consequences, and i would honestly be shocked to find out fennell wasn't a highsmith fan. at times this script feels almost like a re-imagining of the talented mr. ripley for the millennial generation; albeit one cleverly tailored to the sensibilities and sexual fluidity of the euphoria crowd. the use of hyper-stylized cinematography, as well as the film's decidedly ""in vogue"" choice of music, also evoke the style of that series to a degree. that said, jacob elordi playing against type as the rich aristocrat felix catton (ostensibly a spoiled playboy, but whose surprising sensitive side may reveal him to be an actual decent person) subverts those expectations in the best way.whatever the reality behind her inspiration, this film is in no way a mere imitation of another work. instead, fennell more than proves her mettle as a writer/director capable of executing her unique ideas with extreme precision. frankly, she couldn't seem more at home in the genre, and despite a concept that on the surface may appear to be aiming at mere homage, fennell spares no time proving that notion false; taking a deceptively original approach to a tried and true theme, and running with it to intoxicating effect.saltburn is an utterly enthralling mystery, with an impressively sustained blend of familiarity and unpredictability. the script is brimming with witty dialogue, wickedly dark humor, compelling social commentary on class division, and no shortage of clever twists. all in all, this makes for a fiercely captivating affair from start to finish. so much so, in fact, that when the many disparate threads finally start to come together in the final act, the result is harrowing and nothing short of extraordinary!this is filmmaking of the highest order from someone who is quickly becoming one of the most interesting artists working today. if it wasn't such a crowded year i would say fennell was a shoe-in for another best original screenplay nom. although then again, when considering the uncomfortable nature of certain moments in the film, it may be a stretch to think the academy is ready to vote for something this far out. i hope they're not all too close-minded to recognize fennell's talent though, and this at least ends up getting some (well-deserved) awards attention. in any case, if she's able to keep up the momentum then her work will soon be impossible to ignore, no matter how dark/insane she decides to go with her next project. personally, i'd love to see her re-team with keoghan/mulligan and try her hand at a full-on horror flick!anyways, beyond the film's critical reception, what perhaps will be most interesting is seeing the overall response it gets from general audiences. i'd imagine they won't be expecting just how shocking certain aspects of the story are, and all those forming their expectations based on her first film (like i did) are likely to be caught off guard by a handful of these scenes (if not outright turned off). the film never felt in any way exploitative or pretentious to me though. on the contrary, i felt like the balance and tone that it struck were basically flawless. even if a small number of viewers do find it too offensive, that will probably just add to the allure of the film. ultimately, the purity of conviction shown by the creative team in taking things as far as they did clearly panned out.suffice it to say, i've never seen anything quite like this film, and i was completely blown away. in fact, for me, it rather handily beats out oppenheimer, beau is afraid, and killers of the flower moon as the best of the year, and i'd go so far as to call it a film destined to be discussed, analyzed, argued over, and admired by cinephiles of every kind for years to come.finally, i'd be remiss not to mention the film's true oscar potential, and that's barry keoghan. his raw performance as the socially awkward, yet smart and deeply enigmatic loner oliver quick is so brilliantly nuanced, mysterious, and disturbing that i can all but guarantee it will ""make your blood run cold."" barry is absolutely the underdog to look out for come award season, and this film proves, decisively, that he was the perfect choice to take up the mantle of the joker.rating: 9.5/10.....edited to add - i can't believe i forgot to praise the incredible use of ""murder on the dance floor"" in one of the film's final montages. i've been waiting forever for someone to re-tap the potential of the song, and its use here might be the best of any hit since the pixies' ""where is my mind?"" swelled up at the end of fight club."

","oliver, a seemingly working-class oxford student, falls in with a group of upper-class kids, one of whom invites him to his huge old stately home (saltburn) and may be an object of obsession for him. oliver is thus, or roughly thus, led into elaborate lies and worse. my uncertainties here are because the plot is never really clear.it's probably not a deliberate irony that the film often appears to want to be the talented mr. ripley, possibly the greatest story ever about wanting to be someone else. unfortunately, it also apes, by turns, brideshead revisited, the servant and the little stranger. these impulses are not compatible and all said precursors are vastly superior.the script's one real strength lies in the area where writer-director emerald fennel was, presumably, able to write what she knows not from other people's art but her own experience: an upper-class british person herself, her depictions of upper-class british people are mercilessly perfect, ably abetted by very funny performances from richard e. grant and, especially, rosamund pike.but that accounts for about five minutes in an otherwise quite astonishingly amateurish mess. oliver is either the sad sexual obsessive of ripley or the single-mindedly sociopathic revanchist class warrior of the servant. the two do not go together; the only real guiding principle seems to be whatever transgressive, would-be shocking image fennel wants to show us. furthermore, in class warrior guise, oliver is supposed to be carrying out an elaborate, precisely calibrated, 5d chess stratagem that in reality depends on absurdly impossible luck and the fog-brained gullibility of everyone else concerned.this review is a rewrite. fennel should, at best, have done more of those herself. her film's grainy, grimy, fashion-shoot prettiness, which seduced me a little at first - hence the rewrite - has soured over time like perfume used to cover up the smell of putrefying corpses. it's bad enough that fennel has written characters stupid enough to be duped by such transparent ruses. it's wqrse that she seems to expect this of her viewers too - and perhaps even a little worse yet that some of them, on the evidence of these reviews, have fallen in line."

","evidently the jinx of the ""sophomore slump"" held no claim over emerald fennell, britain's new filmmaking auteur and cinematic wunderkind. in only her second movie, the popular writer-director has already soared past expectations, delivering a film which not only far surpasses the success of her debut promising young woman (which was excellent), but which succeeds so well in all its ambitions that it just might belong in the conversation for genre classic. it certainly ranks quite high among my personal favorites for films of its kind.in my opinion, saltburn is a masterpiece. a purely singular, cinematic tour-de-force, with an abundance of style, all put to use in service of a story that is both attractive and engrossing, while never ceasing to be entertaining. it's the kind of film that sears itself in your memory with its brazenness-to say nothing of the level of prurience that permeates some of the more salacious/depraved bits. i know that sounds like it could be a negative, but believe me, it definitely works in this film's favor; keeping the tone both erotically charged as well as deeply unsettling. in fact, the whole film is astoundingly well-balanced, maintaining a sly confidence in itself which makes it all the more entrancing despite (because of?) it taking things to such extremes. occasionally you might feel like recoiling, but you'll remain unable to look away.since the film only released wide several weeks ago, i'll refrain from saying much about plot specifics in this review (nothing beyond superficial comparison anyway), as i'd hate to spoil anyone from having the same incredible experience i had going in blind. this is an opportunity that hopefully most people will be afforded, owing to the stellar marketing for the film which somehow managed to build intrigue without revealing hardly anything about the story (take note studio heads, this is how it should be done!). it's an especially blessed achievement in this case, as this is a film with a deviously good script and it'd be a shame to miss out on its myriad surprises.additionally, with saltburn, emerald fennell has not only gifted us fans of crime/mystery stories with a modern genre masterpiece, she has also given us the best ripley movie without tom ripley. indeed, the film evokes a superlative, verging on definitive, homage to the famous amoral hedonist with a knack for escaping consequences, and i would honestly be shocked to find out fennell wasn't a highsmith fan. at times this script feels almost like a re-imagining of the talented mr. ripley for the millennial generation; albeit one cleverly tailored to the sensibilities and sexual fluidity of the euphoria crowd. the use of hyper-stylized cinematography, as well as the film's decidedly ""in vogue"" choice of music, also evoke the style of that series to a degree. that said, jacob elordi playing against type as the rich aristocrat felix catton (ostensibly a spoiled playboy, but whose surprising sensitive side may reveal him to be an actual decent person) subverts those expectations in the best way.whatever the reality behind her inspiration, this film is in no way a mere imitation of another work. instead, fennell more than proves her mettle as a writer/director capable of executing her unique ideas with extreme precision. frankly, she couldn't seem more at home in the genre, and despite a concept that on the surface may appear to be aiming at mere homage, fennell spares no time proving that notion false; taking a deceptively original approach to a tried and true theme, and running with it to intoxicating effect.saltburn is an utterly enthralling mystery, with an impressively sustained blend of familiarity and unpredictability. the script is brimming with witty dialogue, wickedly dark humor, compelling social commentary on class division, and no shortage of clever twists. all in all, this makes for a fiercely captivating affair from start to finish. so much so, in fact, that when the many disparate threads finally start to come together in the final act, the result is harrowing and nothing short of extraordinary!this is filmmaking of the highest order from someone who is quickly becoming one of the most interesting artists working today. if it wasn't such a crowded year i would say fennell was a shoe-in for another best original screenplay nom. although then again, when considering the uncomfortable nature of certain moments in the film, it may be a stretch to think the academy is ready to vote for something this far out. i hope they're not all too close-minded to recognize fennell's talent though, and this at least ends up getting some (well-deserved) awards attention. in any case, if she's able to keep up the momentum then her work will soon be impossible to ignore, no matter how dark/insane she decides to go with her next project. personally, i'd love to see her re-team with keoghan/mulligan and try her hand at a full-on horror flick!anyways, beyond the film's critical reception, what perhaps will be most interesting is seeing the overall response it gets from general audiences. i'd imagine they won't be expecting just how shocking certain aspects of the story are, and all those forming their expectations based on her first film (like i did) are likely to be caught off guard by a handful of these scenes (if not outright turned off). the film never felt in any way exploitative or pretentious to me though. on the contrary, i felt like the balance and tone that it struck were basically flawless. even if a small number of viewers do find it too offensive, that will probably just add to the allure of the film. ultimately, the purity of conviction shown by the creative team in taking things as far as they did clearly panned out.suffice it to say, i've never seen anything quite like this film, and i was completely blown away. in fact, for me, it rather handily beats out oppenheimer, beau is afraid, and killers of the flower moon as the best of the year, and i'd go so far as to call it a film destined to be discussed, analyzed, argued over, and admired by cinephiles of every kind for years to come.finally, i'd be remiss not to mention the film's true oscar potential, and that's barry keoghan. his raw performance as the socially awkward, yet smart and deeply enigmatic loner oliver quick is so brilliantly nuanced, mysterious, and disturbing that i can all but guarantee it will ""make your blood run cold."" barry is absolutely the underdog to look out for come award season, and this film proves, decisively, that he was the perfect choice to take up the mantle of the joker.rating: 9.5/10.....edited to add - i can't believe i forgot to praise the incredible use of ""murder on the dance floor"" in one of the film's final montages. i've been waiting forever for someone to re-tap the potential of the song, and its use here might be the best of any hit since the pixies' ""where is my mind?"" swelled up at the end of fight club."

"752","spiderman","cmtempest",2023-12-10,9," just give barry keoghan his damn oscar already
","evidently the jinx of the ""sophomore slump"" held no claim over emerald fennell, britain's new filmmaking auteur and cinematic wunderkind. in only her second movie, the popular writer-director has already soared past expectations, delivering a film which not only far surpasses the success of her debut promising young woman (which was excellent), but which succeeds so well in all its ambitions that it just might belong in the conversation for genre classic. it certainly ranks quite high among my personal favorites for films of its kind.in my opinion, saltburn is a masterpiece. a purely singular, cinematic tour-de-force, with an abundance of style, all put to use in service of a story that is both attractive and engrossing, while never ceasing to be entertaining. it's the kind of film that sears itself in your memory with its brazenness-to say nothing of the level of prurience that permeates some of the more salacious/depraved bits. i know that sounds like it could be a negative, but believe me, it definitely works in this film's favor; keeping the tone both erotically charged as well as deeply unsettling. in fact, the whole film is astoundingly well-balanced, maintaining a sly confidence in itself which makes it all the more entrancing despite (because of?) it taking things to such extremes. occasionally you might feel like recoiling, but you'll remain unable to look away.since the film only released wide several weeks ago, i'll refrain from saying much about plot specifics in this review (nothing beyond superficial comparison anyway), as i'd hate to spoil anyone from having the same incredible experience i had going in blind. this is an opportunity that hopefully most people will be afforded, owing to the stellar marketing for the film which somehow managed to build intrigue without revealing hardly anything about the story (take note studio heads, this is how it should be done!). it's an especially blessed achievement in this case, as this is a film with a deviously good script and it'd be a shame to miss out on its myriad surprises.additionally, with saltburn, emerald fennell has not only gifted us fans of crime/mystery stories with a modern genre masterpiece, she has also given us the best ripley movie without tom ripley. indeed, the film evokes a superlative, verging on definitive, homage to the famous amoral hedonist with a knack for escaping consequences, and i would honestly be shocked to find out fennell wasn't a highsmith fan. at times this script feels almost like a re-imagining of the talented mr. ripley for the millennial generation; albeit one cleverly tailored to the sensibilities and sexual fluidity of the euphoria crowd. the use of hyper-stylized cinematography, as well as the film's decidedly ""in vogue"" choice of music, also evoke the style of that series to a degree. that said, jacob elordi playing against type as the rich aristocrat felix catton (ostensibly a spoiled playboy, but whose surprising sensitive side may reveal him to be an actual decent person) subverts those expectations in the best way.whatever the reality behind her inspiration, this film is in no way a mere imitation of another work. instead, fennell more than proves her mettle as a writer/director capable of executing her unique ideas with extreme precision. frankly, she couldn't seem more at home in the genre, and despite a concept that on the surface may appear to be aiming at mere homage, fennell spares no time proving that notion false; taking a deceptively original approach to a tried and true theme, and running with it to intoxicating effect.saltburn is an utterly enthralling mystery, with an impressively sustained blend of familiarity and unpredictability. the script is brimming with witty dialogue, wickedly dark humor, compelling social commentary on class division, and no shortage of clever twists. all in all, this makes for a fiercely captivating affair from start to finish. so much so, in fact, that when the many disparate threads finally start to come together in the final act, the result is harrowing and nothing short of extraordinary!this is filmmaking of the highest order from someone who is quickly becoming one of the most interesting artists working today. if it wasn't such a crowded year i would say fennell was a shoe-in for another best original screenplay nom. although then again, when considering the uncomfortable nature of certain moments in the film, it may be a stretch to think the academy is ready to vote for something this far out. i hope they're not all too close-minded to recognize fennell's talent though, and this at least ends up getting some (well-deserved) awards attention. in any case, if she's able to keep up the momentum then her work will soon be impossible to ignore, no matter how dark/insane she decides to go with her next project. personally, i'd love to see her re-team with keoghan/mulligan and try her hand at a full-on horror flick!anyways, beyond the film's critical reception, what perhaps will be most interesting is seeing the overall response it gets from general audiences. i'd imagine they won't be expecting just how shocking certain aspects of the story are, and all those forming their expectations based on her first film (like i did) are likely to be caught off guard by a handful of these scenes (if not outright turned off). the film never felt in any way exploitative or pretentious to me though. on the contrary, i felt like the balance and tone that it struck were basically flawless. even if a small number of viewers do find it too offensive, that will probably just add to the allure of the film. ultimately, the purity of conviction shown by the creative team in taking things as far as they did clearly panned out.suffice it to say, i've never seen anything quite like this film, and i was completely blown away. in fact, for me, it rather handily beats out oppenheimer, beau is afraid, and killers of the flower moon as the best of the year, and i'd go so far as to call it a film destined to be discussed, analyzed, argued over, and admired by cinephiles of every kind for years to come.finally, i'd be remiss not to mention the film's true oscar potential, and that's barry keoghan. his raw performance as the socially awkward, yet smart and deeply enigmatic loner oliver quick is so brilliantly nuanced, mysterious, and disturbing that i can all but guarantee it will ""make your blood run cold."" barry is absolutely the underdog to look out for come award season, and this film proves, decisively, that he was the perfect choice to take up the mantle of the joker.rating: 9.5/10.....edited to add - i can't believe i forgot to praise the incredible use of ""murder on the dance floor"" in one of the film's final montages. i've been waiting forever for someone to re-tap the potential of the song, and its use here might be the best of any hit since the pixies' ""where is my mind?"" swelled up at the end of fight club."

","it's quite insane, and i love it. i don't entirely agree with the comments suggesting that ""oliver is money-sexual."" his meticulous design from the beginning is to get close to felix, creating a connection beyond the distant and almost pitiful distance between the prince and the dark corner.it seems similar to ""genius loci,"" but there are subtle differences in emotional depth and direction. the male lead in genius loci wants to become the second male lead, live the second male lead's life, secretly wear his clothes and shoes when the second male lead is not at home - desires surpassing mere infatuation.oliver is different. he enters oxford, glimpses felix through the window surrounded by a courtyard crowd, and falls deeply in love with him at first sight.oliver is an outsider, an oddity, despite being intelligent and diligent-reading fifty books in one summer, writing a substantial thesis, knowledgeable, yet unable to win the affection or even much attention from classmates.he knows what type of person felix would be interested in, understands what roles his middle-class background (actually, upper-middle class) allows him to play. the roles with the highest chance of success, the scripts most likely to secure friendships - he grabs them all.a significant part of oliver's infatuation with felix is due to felix's privileged background. it's the upper class that can nurture someone like felix - carefree, handsome, and charming. easily garnering affection from everyone at parties, pointing out the most beautiful girls, a comprehensive abundance in both material and emotional aspects.oliver might lament the lack of love for him, while felix frets over too much love from others.felix's sympathy for the weak is his virtue, a trait oliver exploits. this kindness seems pure but also like an aloof upper-class person observing a human tragedy from a distance - akin to an audience enjoying a spectacular death in a horror movie, sighing with a mix of sympathy and satisfaction.but pamela, oliver, and the briefly mentioned ""eddie from last summer,"" each one of them is vividly alive.felix and his mother squeeze stories out of their ""friends,"" just like losing interest in a once-beloved movie after repeated viewings. the ""friends,"" along with their luggage, are sent away by the loyal butler at night or in the morning, never disturbing the master's enjoyment of solitude.oliver's infatuation with felix deepens time and again. it's inevitable. despite having money in his wallet, he pretends not to when paying the bill. though he's 80% sure felix is aware of his predicament, when felix actually walks over, pays for him, and adds, ""i found the money you dropped on the ground,"" to save face in front of the bartender, oliver is genuinely relieved.when it's good, it's genuinely good, like the radiant sun finally noticing the weeds growing in the corner and generously bathing them in warm light. the warmth is so comforting that, having experienced it once, you never want to go back to the damp, sunless corner.oliver wants to be felix's friend, a good friend, preferably invited to live in the dreamy castle forever.when felix's cousin mocks him, saying, ""living in the castle is a dream for you, something you can only reminisce about in the future. but for me, this is my home, and i can return anytime.""what is oliver thinking? probably that even if it's a dream, he wants to replace reality with it, to be intoxicated in this dream for a long, long time.he doesn't plan to tell children the story of that summer on a recliner decades later. he wants to plunder the master of this dream, deviously stealing the authority to dream.what if felix forgives him, responds to this love, even if it's just a little, forgiving his deception, letting him stay in the castle? it's an ideal and perfect scenario that shatters. only plundering, only treacherous acts remain. he kills the love that won't stay and trades it for a castle that can only be guarded in place.crazy love, crazy infatuation. i wonder, what if felix forgives? what if he responds to this love?this is a direction untouched by both ""genius loci"" and this movie, and a direction that could never be explored. if it did, it might turn into... an original bl story?haha."

","emerald fennell is a filmmaker whom i said i would be eagerly awaiting her next film ever since her feature film directorial debut with promising young woman. she was put on the map when her film received multiple oscar nominations, including a win. i thought that film was great, so there was no chance i was missing out on her latest, saltburn. after viewing it, all i can say is wow. i'm still comprehending it all, but it sure was quite the experience. saltburn is probably for a very small number of people, but the gross nature of the film and the filmmaking itself is far too good to look away. i'm sure some viewers will think i'm crazy for liking this film as much as i did, but here's why.the premise is fairly simple. oliver quick (barry keoghan) becomes very close to his classmate at oxford university, felix catton (jacob elordi). during the summer break, felix invites oliver to his family home, a mansion filled with a few, very interesting characters. i don't want to ruin the film, so i'll leave the premise at that, but this is one crazy, sadistic, disgusting, and wild summer that the film explores. this is a role that keoghan was born to play as well because he just let himself embody this character like there was no tomorrow. he gives a terrific performance here, but he portrays a character i hope i never have to be around.alison oliver is great as felix's sister venetia and elordi himself does some of his best work yet, but archie madekwe is becoming an actor i can't wait to continue watching. his portrayal of farleigh start was one of the highlights of the film. the best friend of felix, who is also kind of the one who is the outsider. his character was almost the glue this film needed to thread everything together. i took notice of him earlier this year in gran turismo (which is a film that i believe is underrated and more people should watch) and i think we may just see him explode shortly. his talents seem to be going under the radar right now.aside from all the great performances, i kind of already praised the direction, but emerald fennell does a stellar job here. linus sandgren is one of the biggest stars of this film though. his cinematography here is perfect. with not many different set pieces, he utilizes every bit of it that he can. the framework here astonished me. for such a small scale, it feels bigger than it is. i also hope that victoria boydell gets some recognition for the editing work here. a dinner scene in particular stands out to me, as a camera is on each of the characters and not one emotion is missed. i thought that scene in particular was cut together.saltburn is a film that goes for it in every way that it wants to. how emerald fennell even came up with some of the ideas in this film is beyond me and will likely make half of the viewers turn the film off, but i was so engaged that i just went with it. i couldn't believe some of the things i was watching oliver do, but i believe that was the point. i can't stress enough that this is a hard one to recommend to many people, but i will still say that i loved it. the ending is also satisfying if it's a film you enjoy from beginning to end. now available to stream on prime video, do with this review what you will."

","saltburn is mesmerizingly incomprehensible and utterly pretentious. its most intriguing quality is attempting to make sense of its dizzyingly absurd and unbelievable plot. the mere mention of the incomparable brideshead revisited in the same breath is near blasphemy. the characters are devoid of any dimension and lack motivation in their robotic machinations. some scenes are slow and agonizingly long, while some scenes that have a whiff of emotion, such as when oliver and felix go to oliver's parents, are frustratingly cut short of development and resolution. moreover, barry keoghan as super oxford student is about as convincing as elizabeth warren's assertion that she is a cherokee indian. thankfully there is jacob elordi whose raffish good looks and spirited performance, as well as that of rosalind pike., bring much needed relief to the absurd proceedings. on the plus side are the gorgeous settings and frequently beautiful music, but nonetheless they are not enough to make up for the mind-numbing script. and that last scene!!! heaven help us."

","saltburn, a sophomore feature by emerald fennell, has been a subject of debate among critics and viewers. some view the film as flashy and self-satisfied, while others see it as a successful erotic thriller with titillating shocks. the film has had a successful limited release in the us and expanded nationwide. however, some critics argue that the film's visuals, such as a character slurping another's bathwater and a cocky ending, may be a sign of perverse genius or cheap tricks masquerading as it. the film has gained popularity on tiktok, with many expressing a rift between its staff and the film's overall aesthetic. the saltburn divide is not a satire film but rather its artifices, including visual provocations, luxe tableaus, and bold telegraphing of desire. vibes are a powerful tool in cinema, allowing audiences to process entertainment that is predominantly based on them. they can be a portal to the intangible particulars of another time, place, or era, as seen in sofia coppola's impressionistic priscilla. many festival circuit films this year, such as raven jackson's all dirt roads taste of salt, jonathan glazer's zone of interest, annie baker's janet planet, and steve mcqueen's occupied city, use feelings, mood, visual language, and sensory experience to communicate the unspoken human experience. these films argue against the tyranny of story in how we evaluate screen-based media, allowing audiences to experience the unspoken human experience through their cinematic experiences. saltburn is a film by fennell that showcases the eccentricities of its characters, but it lacks a cohesive plot. the film's main problem is that most of its plotting is saved for the final stretch, with fennell being vague about everyone's motivations and actions. this results in the film drifting along and suddenly hurries through several major revelations with the speed of someone who wants to reach the end of an anecdote before their phone battery runs out. some of these revelations are more ingenious than others, but fennell is prone to fumble them and has little to say about class divisions that hasn't been said more pithily in several recent films. saltburn may seem half-hearted and lacks the focused anger of promising young woman. however, if seen as a lurid pulp fantasy rather than a penetrating satire, it is deliriously enjoyable. the dialogue and performances are what clinch it, with oliver being awestruck by the priceless old masters on the house's oak-panelled walls and pike, grant, and mulligan competing to be the most obnoxious. keoghan delivers an impressively committed performance in a movie that considers itself shocking, with ""saltburn's"" final scene being the most true representation. the film's beauty and emptyness are evident, but fennell's set-up leaves viewers wanting more. the final scene is a bravura tracking shot."

","saltburn, a sophomore feature by emerald fennell, has been a subject of debate among critics and viewers. some view the film as flashy and self-satisfied, while others see it as a successful erotic thriller with titillating shocks. the film has had a successful limited release in the us and expanded nationwide. however, some critics argue that the film's visuals, such as a character slurping another's bathwater and a cocky ending, may be a sign of perverse genius or cheap tricks masquerading as it. the film has gained popularity on tiktok, with many expressing a rift between its staff and the film's overall aesthetic. the saltburn divide is not a satire film but rather its artifices, including visual provocations, luxe tableaus, and bold telegraphing of desire. vibes are a powerful tool in cinema, allowing audiences to process entertainment that is predominantly based on them. they can be a portal to the intangible particulars of another time, place, or era, as seen in sofia coppola's impressionistic priscilla. many festival circuit films this year, such as raven jackson's all dirt roads taste of salt, jonathan glazer's zone of interest, annie baker's janet planet, and steve mcqueen's occupied city, use feelings, mood, visual language, and sensory experience to communicate the unspoken human experience. these films argue against the tyranny of story in how we evaluate screen-based media, allowing audiences to experience the unspoken human experience through their cinematic experiences. saltburn is a film by fennell that showcases the eccentricities of its characters, but it lacks a cohesive plot. the film's main problem is that most of its plotting is saved for the final stretch, with fennell being vague about everyone's motivations and actions. this results in the film drifting along and suddenly hurries through several major revelations with the speed of someone who wants to reach the end of an anecdote before their phone battery runs out. some of these revelations are more ingenious than others, but fennell is prone to fumble them and has little to say about class divisions that hasn't been said more pithily in several recent films. saltburn may seem half-hearted and lacks the focused anger of promising young woman. however, if seen as a lurid pulp fantasy rather than a penetrating satire, it is deliriously enjoyable. the dialogue and performances are what clinch it, with oliver being awestruck by the priceless old masters on the house's oak-panelled walls and pike, grant, and mulligan competing to be the most obnoxious. keoghan delivers an impressively committed performance in a movie that considers itself shocking, with ""saltburn's"" final scene being the most true representation. the film's beauty and emptyness are evident, but fennell's set-up leaves viewers wanting more. the final scene is a bravura tracking shot."

""the last wish"" expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the oscar-nominated 2011 original ""puss in boots."" joining banderas and his longtime friend and co-star salma hayek pinault are florence pugh, olivia colman, ray winstone, da'vine joy randolph, and john mulaney, among many others. they bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor. but of course, the fast-paced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director joel crawford and co-director januel mercado's film. the film's aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences, especially during the action sequences, but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight. from the moss growing on a fearsome forest giant to the shiny silkiness of puss' whiskers blowing in the wind, ""the last wish"" offers a variety of eye-popping details. and it frequently features dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves to transition from past to present or one scene to the next. but the film also manages to convey messages of selflessness and teamwork in a way that doesn't feel heavy-handed or cloying. and the stellar voice performances and dazzling visuals keep things so engaging you won't need a laser pointer or a catnip-stuffed mouse toy to entertain you."
"903","puss n boots","misssimonetta",2023-02-11,8," i was actually moved by the existential crisis of this cartoon cat
","cs lewis once said a children's story that only appeals to children is not a good children's film in the least. i can think of plenty of crummy kids' movies that illustrate the point, but i'd rather bring up a positive example-- puss in boots: the last wish.i cannot believe i am saying this about a shrek spinoff, but this movie really is that good. it works on so many levels: as a high-speed comedy, all the jokes land, but as a story about mortality and the meaning of life, this film is oddly compelling and mature. the plot literally involves puss running from the personification of death, hoping to cling to his life. in between the funny scenes, i was actually moved by the existential crisis of this cartoon cat. that's no small feat.this is truly a movie kids and adults can cherish."
"904","puss n boots","cardsrock",2023-07-16,9," simply outstanding
","i can't say i expected this from a puss in boots sequel 12 years later. the last wish is a true standout feature of 2022 and one of the best animated films in some time.the new art style, clearly inspired by spider-verse, feels right at home in this world. i love how it blended the typical cgi look with the new, more hand-drawn style. that combined with some top notch humor and an incredibly emotional story makes this a terrific watch. the film is very singularly focused on puss's arc, leading to some very satisfying story beats. i had a wonderful time watching this movie and i can't recommend it enough."
"905","puss n boots","bbevis-47954",2022-12-23,9," aged like fine wine.
","puss and boots the last wish is a fantastic sequel and inarguably better than the charming first outing. the animation is brilliant, characters are charming, pacing is tight, very funny and the action is excellent. not to mention there is a ton of heart. if i were to nitpick i think one of the antagonists trumps the other. one is played for more comedic purposes while the other is an intimidating physical presence for boots to contend with. the last wish has something for everyone and it's probably one of the better animated movies i've seen in sometime. i really don't want to get into the story to avoid spoilers because the movie was a lot of fun, and it's best to go into it fresh. if anyone is considering taking their family to see the last wish like i did then the last wish is an easy recommendation. 100% worth the money. two thumbs up for team friendship."
"906","puss n boots","ericstevenson",2022-12-26,10," my pick for best picture 2022
","the last ""puss in boots"" movie was made 11 years ago, as well as the last film the ""shrek"" franchise, so surely they couldn't make something really great again, right? the story is pretty standard, as puss in boots is down to his last life and tries to get a wish on a magic star. it seriously has some of the best action i've seen in a long time. i don't even think this film qualifies as a comedy. it really is more like a straightforward action flick. even its first five minutes are nothing but nonstop action from frame 1 to frame...whatever.this film does not take place before the shrek films. we get to see some brief flashbacks with shrek himself, albeit only for a few seconds. the villains are big jack horner, goldilocks and the three bears, and a wolf. i believe a poster called this character the big bad wolf, but he isn't that, even if he's technically based on him (he's actually death). every one of these villains are unique with their own motivations. every minute makes me eager to find out what happens next.so...who does get the wish in the end? nobody! everyone (except big jack horner) realizes they had what they wanted after awhile. it even begins with another sequel hook with puss in boots going back to far far away land. another shrek/puss in boots movie? if it has such amazing cel shading animation with the best cgi of all, it deserves as many films as possible! ****"
"907","puss n boots","3xhcch",2022-12-08,8," a darker dreamworks
","puss in boots (antonio banderas) becomes a popular folk hero in his country. after his latest conquest of a giant monster, he was killed by a freak accident with a church bell. when he woke up, puss realized that he already spent eight of his nine lives, and that he only had one more life to live. at first he did not think it was a big deal, but a traumatic encounter with a sinister-looking wolf (wagner moura) made puss decide to retire from adventures.while living the life of a spoiled lazy lap cat, puss learned about a wishing star from the family of goldilocks (florence pugh) and the three bears (ray winstone, olivia colman and samson kayo) who were looking for it. puss decided to search for the star himself in order to wish for his nine lives back. along with puss on his quest were his old flame kitty softpaws (selma hayek) and a nameless little orphan therapy dog (harvey guillen).this sequel to the first ""puss in boots"" solo spin-off movie came out 11 years after the original. there is a very evident difference that can be noted in the style of its animation. on top of the 3d computer-generated images of the characters, there is now an additional 2d artistic style as if they were hand-painted (first seen in ""the bad guys""), especially noted most prominently in the character of the wolf, and even in puss during their showdown fight scenes.the voice work of the actors really captured the personalities of the characters. antonio banderas's voice had the bravado, arrogance and charisma of puss, whom we've known and loved since he made his first appearance in ""shrek 2"" (2004). selma hayek lends her sexy sassiness to the voice of the skillful thief kitty softpaws, who held a grudge against puss. florence pugh's characteristic raspiness was easily recognizable in goldilocks's voice.like before, the characters puss encounters were all fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters. the choice for main antagonist was jack horner, the boy who sat in the corner eating his pies, but he was not little here anymore. he was not as famous as others, so some kids may need a review of his rhyme to refamiliarize. there were a trove of disney character references you'll have fun identifying, from mary poppins, alice in wonderland and jiminy cricket.very notable in this latest dreamworks release is the darkness of the plot, which was also reflected in the artwork styles and situations depicted. only in trickles, but this must be the first time blood was seen in a dreamworks animated film. the language and humor used was also more mature, even with some assumed expletives bleeped out. as the topic of death played a major part in the story, scenes with the wolf can be very scary for little kids. 8/10.ps: the new dreamworks animation opening logo precedes this film. it was quite nostalgic to see the dreamworks boy seeing famous dreamworks characters old an new -- like toothless, po, boss baby, a troll, the bad guys and of course, shrek with fiona and donkey -- as his crescent moon flew him around in space before settling in its place."
"908","puss n boots","genti26",2022-12-13,8," not only fun, but heartfelt too.
","this is genuinely one of my favorite films of the year. i hope it gets real recognition and people don't dismiss it as ""just an animated film"".i've always liked dreamworks films, with my favorite being how to train your dragon 2, but after rewatching the first puss in boots movie, i wasn't expecting much for this sequel, eleven years after. i like the first installment for sure but it's certainly a lot simpler in story than i'd prefer. this one however, has such a rich emotional aspect to it that i truly felt something during it.there were also certain scenes involving a wolf character that were quite creepy. i think kids will have a lot of fun with this movie, but at the core this is a story about family and understanding the value of things and/or people who are in front of you already. and that's a message that every person of any age can get something out of. the voice acting is top-notch and the animation is such a ridiculous step-up from the last time. this is such a cool direction to take this sequel into and i dug it all the way through.there's really not much negative to say other than the ending feels like it should have been slightly more concise, but that's it. i loved it and i'll rewatch it as soon as it releases on vod."
"909","puss n boots","siggirules",2022-12-07,9," dreamworks best movie besides shrek and how to train your dragon!
","i did not have many expectations going into this with my daughter, i've seen the main shrek movies but noon of the other puss in boot's spin-offs. i was shocked at how good a movie this was when the credits rolled!the story itself is functional, but all characters are given meaningful and relatable arcs. between the melanchonic puss reaching the end of his days as a great hero, his always positive dog sidekick and the 3 antagonistic parties trying to reach the magical macguffin there is a lot going on and none of it feels forced in.the two greatest assets the movie brings is it's humor and the stunning action scenes. first of all, this movie has bite, it is back to the tone of the first shrek movie with lots of jokes that are working on a children and adult level of understanding. while the story is easy to follow for kids, the themes explored are relatively mature and will keep adults engaged.secondly, while disney/pixar movies lately fail to make action exiting with their polished cgi style, puss in boots goes full into the spiderverse once a fight breaks out. glorious 12 frames per second, hyper stylized with all the filters and gimmicks necessary to elevate the big set-pieces to something truly special and memorable. especially puss's duels against a mysterious bounty hunter are the highlights.while not entirely original, the puss in boots: the last wish combines the edgy humor of shrek with the visual wonders of into the spiderverse and strings it along a relatively matured heroes journey coming to it's end tale that is closer to logan than any other animation i can think off. oh and just in case (not that i personally care much about it) there is zero political agenda to be found here to be a distraction of the perception."
"910","puss n boots","avwillfan89",2023-01-21,8," a return to form indeed.
","i was not at all interested in watching this film. as most of the animated movies from the major studios, especially from dreamworks have been extremely dull and very samey. i can't think of a good one that i've seen since how to train your dragon 2.but then i read all of the brilliant reviews and decided to give this one a go. and to my surprise, it was definitely a welcome change.puss gets an existential crises when death (aka the big bad wolf) comes for his last life after puss has frivolously wasted his 8 other ones. it's interesting how dark it gets in these scenes, with puss, who has never been afraid of death, gets scared and has a wakeup call. and learns to value life and the lives of others a bit more.although it doesn't go as far as i thought it would when it came to heavy themes and character development, it certainly reminded me of the good old days of dreamworks animation. so i absolutely consider this film a step in the right direction for this studio."
"911","puss n boots","ucladude1",2022-12-24,9," unexpectedly good for adults and kids
","fyi, surprisingly, kids understood jokes aimed at adults. yes, there are spots of the movies where it's hard to know what they understand because ideas aim at us adults. but, i think the kids still understood it enjoyed the deeper parts.personally, the movie was very fitting. like puss, i'm also trying to find out who i am and who i want to be in life. this was our journey.the stories have great connections romantically, between rivals and newcomers. the stories are about bringing all of us together despite what happened in the past. the stories come together about building a better future for all of us. let go of selfish wants and desires, focus on others and let's work together for a better future!"

","puss in boots: the last wish provides a fun adventure with meaningful lessons and tons of vibrant action. donde est√° la leche?the first 30 minutes of the movie are filled with your typical puss as he sings, dances, and fights with his ever-so-charismatic yet cocky personality. he is quickly humbled when he finds out he needs to be more careful with his life, and this is where i was instantly hooked.then enters the big bad wolf, from the wolf's menacing character design, skin trembling voice to the life-threatening fighting style. wolf was one of the fantastic antagonists. i questioned whether this would be too much for the younger audience because the wolf's scenes struck fear in our beloved puss. although, as a viewer, we know nothing serious will happen, i felt this was a strong enough case for the plot.it didn't end there; we are introduced to various fairytale characters. i am not going to spoil too much.overall, the movie is fast-paced, has adult humor, and represents a love story, greed, and the beauty of friendship.verdict: puss in boots: the last wish is a fun time for the family; i would suggest watching it if you have younger ones. even if you don't have younger ones and are a fan of the shrek universe, it's worth the watch. shoutout to antonio banderas and salma hayek for there wonderful performances!"
"913","puss n boots","nicolasroop",2022-12-07,9," finally!! a genuinely good animated kids movie!!
","seems that these days all the animated kids movies are more or less the same, with very few exceptions in recent years and it's grown tiresome. it's always potty humor and/or a weak storyline that either has adults rolling their eyes or falling asleep. this is one of the exceptions.with pitch perfect voice acting from all parts of the cast, to the way it makes old story concepts feel relatively fresh and funny again, this one is a winner. best of all was the film doesn't rely on low brow, toilet humor to sell it's laughs. my favorite of which came from a certain play on jiminy cricket that i'm sure will have you in stitches.the animation had me a bit underwhelmed which is why i deduct a star, but that is subjective, so i leave that bit up to the viewer to decide for themselves. for me, when the action gets going, it felt glitchy and incomplete, but some people might enjoy that style.overall, i highly recommend this one when it releases later this month. it's definitely a film that both kids and parents will find entertaining and enjoyable. i know i enjoyed it.4.5 retired heros out of 5."

","i genuinely cannot believe i'm saying this, but this is one of the best movies of the year, so far, it's neck to neck with the menu for me.incredible on every front.the animation is incredible. i'm beyond thrilled that dreamworks decided to ditch the hyper-realistic animation style, and just went for a style that would perfectly represent the emotions and craziness that this movie needed.the characters, every single one, was so fleshed out, and they all felt like they had a purpose being there. we didn't get the usual shrek style, grimm fairytale cameos for no reason, on the contrary, they all played an important role in the story, and in the overall message.this movie also had me so emotional, no spoilers, but it's the way the creators handle their characters, with such sincerity and heart.finally, the action, and the plot itself, it was go go go from the get go, i haven't seen a more well paced film all year, i think that is my favourite part of the dilm (avatar 2 could take some notes)overall, it was truly such a blast, so fun, heartfelt, funny, genuine, with a great message at its core."

""sequels to spin-offs of beloved franchises are pointless exercises in brand awareness! why on earth are you giving this one a 10?!?""because this movie...is different than the others. different in that it strives to be a funnier, deeper, prettier, bolder, edgier, (surprisingly) scarier and overall more complete experience than the original puss in boots film over 11 years ago, and unlike that movie holds a distinct accomplishment in simply being a darn fine animated film that stands on its own, one as good as any i've seen in the past few years.the shrekiverse is officially back, and judging by what dreamworks managed to pull off here the world probably isn't ready for whatever comes next. seriously, this gives the first two films in the franchise alone a run for their money.looks like the house that shrek built is finally back on top again.ps: that cricket with the spot-on jimmy stewart voice is one of the funniest things i've seen this year, whoever came up with him deserves a pay raise and a medal and free coffee and recognition from the united nations."

","in an age when movie and tv franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (i'm looking at you, disney), i don't think anyone was expecting much from puss in boots: the last wish - certainly not i.after the first 5 minutes, i knew this was something special.firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from arkane and enter the spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. the 2d elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.the music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).the dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling i think i've ever seen. in a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. the cast do a great job of selling them too. goldi and the bears come out with brilliant british-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.and then there's the wolf. this character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. his style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, i'm serious).at a time when disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - dreamworks have taken on the mantle.it made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. you might think i'm overselling it, but hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.there are those that say that hollywood is done - i know i do. but dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

-very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.adorable characters/feel
-new characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-the feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-has that element of shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.the animation
-it's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy dreamworks does so well.-the design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-the world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that i certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-and it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than disney for the blend of real and cartoons.the voice acting:
-many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that snl like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. he own the horner character and brought some of the best lines.-wagner moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the big-bad wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-pugh is okay, not my favorite role as goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. it does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-banderas takes boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the spanish stereotype. and yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.the references/jokes
-the stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of shrek.-it's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-the fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-it feels like the first two shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. again, refreshing that they were able to step back.the designs changes to an extent
-creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-like into the spiderverse? good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that puss does.-not overused, which is very good for me.the action at times
-shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-this movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-the ending fight shows the potential of what dreamworks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes i've seen this year.the heart
-lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-the movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-there are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. that's hard to do in many things.-i love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-have not felt this way since shrek 2.dislikes:the darkness
-it's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.predictable
-the lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-the movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.too many antagonists
-one of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-they do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.the comedy is still tapered
-it's starting to go back to shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made shrek, shrek.-they took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.the animation changes at times
-the animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-the comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.the action still not complete
--shrek and shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-this movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-the stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-they sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-often was shorter than i wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.the verdict
i must say, puss in boots: the last wish was a much better film than when i walked in. perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. it evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. and it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. this film is indeed a solid return to the world and i had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. however, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance i was looking for. the movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with puss in boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. and the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the shrek that we saw in the first two movies. still, i do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

-new characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-the feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-has that element of shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.the animation
-it's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy dreamworks does so well.-the design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-the world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that i certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-and it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than disney for the blend of real and cartoons.the voice acting:
-many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that snl like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. he own the horner character and brought some of the best lines.-wagner moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the big-bad wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-pugh is okay, not my favorite role as goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. it does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-banderas takes boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the spanish stereotype. and yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.the references/jokes
-the stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of shrek.-it's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-the fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-it feels like the first two shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. again, refreshing that they were able to step back.the designs changes to an extent
-creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-like into the spiderverse? good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that puss does.-not overused, which is very good for me.the action at times
-shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-this movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-the ending fight shows the potential of what dreamworks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes i've seen this year.the heart

"930","puss n boots","wolfinflannel",2023-10-21,10," restored my faith in animated movies!
","puss and boots: the last wish was a true 'feel good' movie. the plot was well thought out and transitioned flawlessly from the last puss and boots film. what made this different from the previous movie is the mature theme and sentiments that made the film enjoyable and illuminating for all ages. the story progression was smooth and did not make the movie feel too short or too long. the story's theme (life is too short, so we must value what we have) flows through several different angles and characters throughout the story. the theme is not lost during the movie and is carried by the protagonist's emotions and personal growth. the characters in this movie helped express the theme and made the film more enjoyable. puss was the perfect protagonist, and his personal growth in the movie showed the audience that it is never too late for a fresh start, especially given that his character did not transition from the last film to the beginning of this one. kitty and pedrito's contrasting personalities and feelings allow two perspectives to get through to puss and show him what it means to be a family. goldy and the three bears added an extra obstacle for 'team friendship' but highlighted the theme through their growth. death was a great character because he was simply doing his job and was the character that indirectly pushed puss to become a better person and respected him for it. jack horner was an excellent antagonist because he was indeed a villain. instead of a character that was hurt by society or had good intentions deep down, this character was a pure monster. it was refreshing to have a villain that everyone could get behind disliking. the dialogue in this movie was powerful. each sentence helped tell the story, and it did not feel like there were any filler lines. the comic relief was natural, and the emotional conversations were deep. the imagery and background in the film were well articulated and detailed. each setting aligned with the active story and flowed with the transitions. the background music of the story was also fitting; it added an extra layer for the viewer and did not distract them from the story. this movie gave hope for the future of animated movies in america."

","this is the best animated feature since into the spider-verse, and probably better than toy story 4 and soul. i don't find many movies rewatchable nowadays and this is one of the few. not only is it a visual masterpiece (huge credit to the animators, well done!) but from a critical standpoint is has extremely well done characters, an engaging and relatable story, and takes very bold actions that will leave animation-lovers stunned for years to come. spoilers would be ruining an experience that you simply must witness for yourself, so what are you waiting for? believe the hype, go watch it if you haven't already! 9.5/10 but imma round up.edit: i've given it a year and came back to it and it's just even better the second viewing. in my opinion this is dreamwork's greatest movie (especially if you take away the first 5 minutes), better than kung fu panda, how to train your dragon, even prince of egypt. also the only dreamworks movie that i think deserves a 10/10. it's one thing to make an actually good and compelling story but to be also very entertaining and engaging for everyone is another feat. the user ratings and critics ratings are way too low. most criticisms of the movie are, imo, flawed, non-existent or biased. i sincerely cannot recommend this movie enough."

'the last wish' may not be among the best films i have ever seen, but it is an interesting and enjoyable watch for sure.the visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the blend of two distinct animation art styles makes for an interesting cinematic experience, the score, too, sprinkled its fair share of magic, and on top of that, the characters are more fleshed out, unlike the last time, and the inclusion of 'perrito' and 'death' brought radical changes to the narrative, their mere presence made this more exciting."

","after losing his eighth life to a bell falling on top of him, puss in boots is down to his last life. an encounter from a vicious bounty hunter with a frightening presence destroys his confidence and for the first time, he feels fear. after escaping by the skin of his teeth, he decides he is no longer worthy of the name puss in boots and begins life as an adopted cat. he learns about the dark forest where someone can make a wish on the wishing star. with this in mind, the crafty feline returns to adventure to get his lives back.a little late to review this movie, but i still caught it in theaters. i knew from the trailer that this would be a cool movie. at first, i was wondering why dreamworks is creating another puss in boots movie. it feels weird to make a sequel to a spin-off that came out over a decade ago. as someone who has not watched the original puss in boots, i do not think you need to watch the original to get what is going on here aside from maybe puss' relationship with kitty softpaws. with that said, let me tell you how good this movie is!puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animated films. first of all, the animation looks absolutely stunning. the movie has probably the best animation from a cgi film i have ever seen. not only do the movement and expressions look smooth and crisp, the cinematography and imagery looks amazing and memorable too. there are many awesome shots in this film such as a shot of puss staring in the eyes of death. these shots strengthen the emotional moments and even some of the funny moments as well. every shot in this movie looks awesome. the animation really shows its fluidity in the action scenes. this movie has better action than 90% percent of the live-action blockbusters out there. the set pieces are so dynamic and entertaining that there is not a boring moment in the film. the opening set piece sets the tone for the entire movie and from that point forward, i knew i was in for a ride. the soundtrack is awesome too from the catchy score to the fun opening song for puss in boots.fantastic visuals aside, the story is memorable too. this movie pushes its pg rating. there is blood, cursing and dark themes that may frighten younger viewers. the story is about how puss is reacting to the idea that he is on deaths door. if he dies one more time, he will be gone forever. this is a movie where we see one of the coolest and most confident characters in animation lose his confidence. with that, he has a character arc that gives him depths and flaws that are relatable so even when he does something kind of selfish, you can still sympathize with his motivations. this movie has a lot of stylish action and funny jokes, but the scenes revolving around the wolf ramp up the dark tone of the movie. it never loses its sense of humor and this is one funny movie. i love the snarky dialogue, perrito gets one scene with goldilocks and the three bears that steals the show comedy wise. this movie has the perfect mix of comedy, action, drama and emotional moments to make it stand out.in addition to a great story, the cast of characters are memorable too. puss is at his best. he is the same awesome and adorable character from shrek, but he is given a lot of vulnerability here. he starts out as this arrogant, but powerful guy who can take down giants, but when he sees that death is coming for him, you can see how it shakes him to the core. his friends kitty softpaws and especially perrito are great characters too. perrito seems like the guy that would annoy everyone, but he is a great support character who is hilarious and just plain adorable. he is also surprisingly aware of emotions. there is one scene with him and puss that warmed my heart.as for the antagonists, the wolf is one of my favorite antagonists in an animated film. he has a badass voice, he completely changes the tone of the movie and he wipes out puss' bravado entirely and reduces him to a frightened cat. he is also a great fighter, but it is his presence, voice, dialogue and whistle that make him truly memorable. kids might have nightmares because of him. goldilocks and the three bears are fun anti-villains that have a sweet bond with each other. then there is the gluttonous scumbag jack horner. this is the character the writers decided to just make as hilariously hatable and disgusting as possible. they make no attempt to give this guy any sympathetic trait and i love it. we need more outright terrible people in new animated films. he is a funny villain with how unapologetic he is towards his minions, but you will be actively rooting for this character's demise.every single character in this film is memorable to a degree. it helps that the voice acting in this movie is excellent with antonio banderas as puss, salma hayek as kitty, harvey gull√©n as perrito, john mulaney as jack horner and especially wagner moura as the wolf. moura might have one of the best voices for a villain in animation i have seen in a while. each person brings their character to life in this movie. i can see any main character here being someone's favorite in the movie. that is how you know that you have a great cast.there is not a dull moment in this movie. puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animation and more. i did not expect a movie like this to be that great, but when i saw the trailers with the gorgeous animation, i knew this movie was going to be a ride. i did not expect it to become one of my favorite films of 2022, but it definitely. i really hope it wins best animated feature at the academy awards this year. dreamworks deserves this one. check it out as soon as you can."

","it may seem like puss in boots: the last wish pointless ridiculous film on the surface ..... but there is a lot to like about this animated dreamworks film; the movie delivers on several levels making it worth your time seeking out . i am praising the overall aesthetic. the animation is more advanced, the movie looked like it was a fairy tale painting. takes advantage of modern cg technologies lovingly paired with more traditional 2d techniques. in the opening, the film uses more hand-drawn techniques like your yesteryear cartoons . and as it progresses the technique harnessed new advancements in cg technology to reintroduce this fairy tale world in new and refreshing way.....it is quite the spectacle to witness and in 3d to boot !!! not the same old cg. in the animation, they actually took off motion blur so that it frames stutters . i have actually never seen animation technique like this before ! really made this fantastical hybrid.puss in boots: the last wish mashed up a spaghetti western with a fairy tale, so you get those beautiful western compositions and staging opportunities, but then you get these fantastical locations born out of your imagination.puss in boots discovers that his passion for adventure has taken its toll: he has burnt through eight of his nine lives. puss sets out on an epic journey to find the mythical last wish and restore his nine lives.and the movie is all brought to life with a cast full of oscar nominated and winner actors; it makes all the sense in the world when you've got an entire universe populated by iconic fairy tale characters like goldilocks (florence pugh), the three bears (olivia colman, ray winstone, and samson kayo), the big bad wolf (wagner moura), little jack horner (john mulaney), and even puss himself (antonio banderas).this is a ""must-see"" for all. there are so many takeaways. this movie kept me wanting more. it was great to see all the fairy tale characters in play wanting something they already possessed, needing to appreciate the moment--learning to be mindful of what we already have around us everyday. it's equal parts exciting and hilarious as well as earnest. puss in boots: the last wish mixes stunning animation with a poignant, surprisingly mature story . 8/10."

"958","puss n boots","oktay_tuna",2023-01-12,9," a strange comparison(with breaking bad) and then some
","in the shrek movies, puss in boots was a very likable character. i think it is safe to assume that most of the people who love shrek (specifically shrek 2) also enjoy seeing puss in boots. it is enjoyable to watch him, doesn't interfere much with the themes of movies but has funny scenes and great action. as i was thinking of these things, i realized something. he is just like saul goodman from breaking bad. saul goodman is a great character in breaking bad. he is great in scenes he is in and is so fun to watch but he isn't much of a character. then better call saul came and saul goodman (jimmy mcgill) became as complex as (if not more) walter. first puss in boots movie wasn't like that for puss. it was more of the same in shrek movies. this movie delivers the character puss in boots desperately needed and then some. his arc in this movie is amazing and in a perfect world, the script of this movie would get an adapted screenplay nomination at the oscars this year (considering the fact that the competition in the adapted screenplay category is nonexistent).death is an amazing villain. having shorter screen time than most characters makes him an even better character. again another comparison to better call saul, death is like lalo salamanca. lalo also doesn't have a big screen time in the six seasons of the show, but he is easily one of the most memorable characters. death is always there, back in the audience's mind, and just when you forget that he exists, he returns. his whistle, his charisma... brilliant!puss and kitty's storyline and conflict are very complex when you remember that this is an animated movie mostly targeted at kids. the themes of legacy, the meaning of life, and the fear of attachment are very refreshing to see in an animated movie again. the addition of perrito creates a great contrast between him and puss and i would even go further to say that it can even spark some philosophical discussions about which way to live is better for you. legacy or living a life where you are comfortable with your family.i loved the additions of the three bears and goldilocks. their storyline was also fairly interesting to see progress but its pacing could have been better, which makes them the weakest links of the film which is a d**n good weak link if you ask me. the character of jack horner. he has very funny moments and is very interesting to see a villain who is truly deeply villainous with no point of return in an animated movie. the conscience bug thing was also interesting to see unfold.the animation and action scenes are superb. especially the ones with death. death is so good that i can't believe it. there are many jokes that land, songs that are fun and most importantly the movie structurally works. it just works. with this many characters, with this many plotlines, with this many detours, you might think that it is impossible to tie this in a great package. but they do. when this movie is at its worst, it is decent but when it is at its best it is one of the best-animated movies, ever.where did this movie come from? i would have wanted to be a kid when i first watched this movie. i would have been scared but i would have loved it. then i would have watched it again, sometime. and then again. it would have created nostalgia and at my age today when i would have looked back i would have said, ""it is not the best-animated movie ever, but it is my favorite animated movie ever."" because it would have been. what more can i say?"

","when i first heard about the last wish, and saw some of the trailers, i thought it was going to be a bit goofy and not as good as the first one (though seeing puss say ""no hablo ingl√©s"" to get out of talking to that dog made me chuckle) and the stylized animation looked cheap and kind of hurt my eyes and i wasn't that interested. however, once i saw a few clips of it, i thought it looked rather interesting and decided to give a shot.after i finally watched it, i have to admit it was actually very good and comparable to the first puss in boots movie and in some cases, even better. the premise was interesting, the animation actually was pretty good, the stylized animation actually worked out pretty well (especially for the action sequences), full of new characters that were funny and cool, and had some important life lessons for everyone to remember and use in their everyday lives.so i liked the premise because puss using up eight of his nine lives and trying to get to the last wish to gain them back while also battling a bunch of other characters who want the wish sets up a cool and interesting story that'll keep you hooked to see who actually gets the wish. you can kind of guess what will happen in the end, but you still want to see what happens regardless.the animation was pretty beautiful as well because although they did not use the realistic animation of the shrek movies or the first puss in boots movie, having it stylized and more comic book-like works out well here as it makes the movie look more vivid and gives you a more fairy tale vibe. plus, there were more details they could add to the characters and the scenery as well. also, as much it kind of looked cheap, the stylized animation worked out well for some of the action scenes and made them look pretty cool and graphic and added more suspense to the fight scenes between the good guys and the bad guys.the characters were also pretty cool as well. puss (once again voiced by antonio banderas) is just as funny, cool, and energetic as he always was in the previous films, kitty softpaws (once again voiced by selma hayek) adds some great humor and banter with puss once again in his mission, and the new characters were quite interesting too. perrito, the little dog (voiced by harvey guill√©n), is pretty funny and although plays the typical annoying sidekick, his role works out pretty well here as he helps puss and kitty. goldilocks and the three bears (voiced by florence pugh, olivia colman, ray winstone, and samson kayo) add some funny humor as well and their banter with each other is quite hilarious as well. big jack horner, one of the villains (voiced by john mulaney), is certainly devious and sarcastic, and his dark humor is ironically quite funny at times (i mean, if he's voiced by mulaney, then obviously it's going to be funny, due to his rather deadpan delivery of his lines).then there's the wolf (voiced by wagner moura), who serves as the other villain in this, but way darker and more sinister than jack horner. specifically, he is really the grim reaper who is after puss for him cheating death eight times and wants to take his last life as punishment, even though puss is still alive. now, when i say this character is dark, he--is--dark! like from his red eyes to his hooded figure to his low, slow, creepy sounding voice to his spine chilling/goosebump inducing whistling to his only intention of claiming puss' last life, this is a dark villain done right and probably one of the best ones in any dreamworks movie in a long time. heck, i was surprised the directors and writers made the wolf as dark as they did as it would certainly freak out some kids, and even some adults as well. at the same time though, i'll give them credit for really stepping it up here and making a very interesting and intimidating villain, as well as not making him a surprise villain too and you knew he was a villain from the beginning (the surprise villain trope has been used too much lately and it was nice to have the obvious villain trope come back once again in my opinion). i would say if you have kids, viewer discretion is advised for the wolf's scenes, but it's just a few scenes and it's not constantly.now for the themes, they were definitely important ones that i believe we all should consider in our daily lives. i won't try to spoil anything with them, but the themes presented in the last wish involve being happy with the family you grew up with even if they're not your biological family, being around people (and animals) that you can trust, and also, accepting that death is an inevitable thing, but that means living life to the fullest and enjoying every moment of it and do not waste it. again, not trying to spoil too much, but they were presented really well in the last wish that will definitely grasp your attention and might even get you thinking about how things are going with your life and might make you consider making some better changes for yourself.alright, so i know that was a lot to say here, but i just wanted to go over everything that i liked about the last wish. i know it's been out for a while now, but for those who haven't seen it yet, i'd recommend giving it a chance because it's definitely one of the better animated movies that have come out in recent years and it's one that i'm sure you'll love instantly once you watch it. it does have its serious moments, but it has a good blend of that and humor and some touching moments that hit you in the feels. lastly, if you're a fan of puss in boots, then seeing him in action once again will definitely satisfy your movie going needs.so if you have netflix, apple tv, or any other streaming service puss in boots: the last wish is on, go watch it!!!"

","'puss in boots: the last wish (2022)' is brilliant. teeming with energy from the moment it begins, this animated adventure is as exhilarating as it is emotionally mature. it balances its swashbuckling action, quick-witted comedy, emotional character work and surprisingly poignant musings on mortality incredibly well. there isn't a moment of the perfectly paced piece that feels out of pace. it truly is an absolute blast. it's also beautiful, with stylishly snappy animation that immediately grabs you by the collar and drags you into the colourful storybook setting. the action scenes, in particular, are a real highlight; you're sure to have a smile on your face for each and every one. except, perhaps, those involving the wolf - not because they aren't wonderful, but because they're shockingly scary. the big bad is genuinely terrifying on occasion and his introductory scene is nothing short of a masterpiece. the internal conflict he inspires in the central character is arguably what elevates the picture to another level, and the literal manifestations of this conflict are inarguably the highlights of the entire affair. the characters all have a good amount of depth to them and they're brought to life with vital voicework that never misses a beat. even the usually annoying cute sidekick is here a sincere, funny and likeable presence that adds genuine value to the narrative. there's very little not to like here. one thing that's perhaps worth mentioning is that there's one scene in which a certain character seems to have been rendered unlit, leading to a distracting sense that the shots in which they appear are literally unfinished. some of the character arcs are predictable and there are a couple of jokes that don't quite land, too. these really are very minor flaws, though. ultimately, this is a ton of fun from start to finish. it's the sort of thing that puts a smile on your face simply because of how well achieved it is. it's phenomenal."

we had to wait 11 years since the last puss boots movie came out in 2011. was it worth it? most audiences are saying yes.antonio banderas is awesome. he can do it all: drama, comedy, musical. i love how he really exaggerates the spanish accent from spain. i lived in spain for a couple of years and adore that beautiful country and its people. i laughed out loud when he properly pronounced ""gazpacho"" with the spanish theta.he and salma hayek make a natural pairing with their comedic timing and hispanic accents.listen for the voices of these talented actors: florence pugh, academy award-winner olivia colman, comedian john mulaney, harvey guillen, da'vine joy randolph, samson kayo, ray winstone, and wagner moura.i laughed out loud so many times. there is so much animated humor, as well as spoken humor.this addition to the puss in boots franchise does a great job of reminding us that puss isn't just a suave fighter, but an actual cat. there's a cuteness battle between puss and kitty that makes for another laugh-out-loud moment.the opening sequence is full of action and humor. what a way to start off a movie in a strong way!the sequence that shows how many times puss in boots died is hilarious.due to the almost non-stop action, the movie has a palpable energy.we see an interesting mixture of 2d and 3d events, keeping things interesting visually, as well as creating a more adventurous look.the story includes several groups of people who are all after the same prize: the ultimate fairytale prize of a wish. the filmmakers explained they were influenced by the famous western movie the good, the bad, and the ugly from 1966. each set of characters has its own story arc with meaningful lessons to be learned along the way.i loved the sweet moment when a certain character started to have a panic attack and was able to calm down by simply petting a soft dog. therapy dogs serve a real and valuable service for many people who need extra support.i hope this addition to the revived shrek universe means we're going to see some more of these fun characters soon.things i didn't like:
parents might get a headache from all the chaotic noise and action.some of the voices didn't match the characters' designs.too many villains and characters to keep track of.it's sad to watch puss in boots wilt under the pressure of imminent death.tips for parents:

","i can't believe it took me a year to finally see this movie. puss in boots: the last wish (pretty terrible title notwithstanding) is an animated masterpiece. it's essentially distilled the formula of what works in an animated family film to such an extent that it feels almost easy, as if the movie wrote itself.this film has such a clever, funny, charming script that hits all of the beats that families will love. you have a dashing hero, a sophisticated love interest, a cute companion, a compelling mcguffin for our characters to chase after, a fully realized and living fantasy world, fun easter eggs, and not one, not two, but three villains who all fit perfectly into the story. it's a film with great and surprisingly weighty themes about what makes life worth living, the inevitable prospect of death, about family, redemption, good and evil.one aspect of the film i really loved was how it handled its villains. we have three, as mentioned before, but all of them play a specific role and communicate pretty fantastic ideas to kids. goldilocks & the bears are the sympathetic lot tossed into villainy because of (somewhat understandable) circumstance. the big bad wolf is a personification of the inevitability of death and other aspects of evil we can't escape. and jack horner, perhaps best of all, reminds kids that no, not all people can be redeemed. some people are just purely evil and you should avoid them.the script is also super tight, full of satisfying call backs, excellent character moments for every single member of the cast...and a lot of that has to do with the animation as well.it's a year later, so you don't need anyone to tell you about how gorgeous this movie looks; into the spiderverse and its eclectic, mesmerizing 2.5d style of animation is the best thing to happen to american animation since pixar. the movie is lush, beautiful, and colourful, but also is an excellent showcase for why animation just might be our best medium of storytelling. i kept thinking of how efficient this film was with conveying information and realized, of course it is, it's animated. there's so much you can do here that you can't with live action, and this film truly internalizes that. puss in boots isn't a great movie in spite of being animated. it's a great movie because it's animated."

puss in boots the last wish is a pleasant surprise in just about every way, bringing us an exciting new adventure for everyone's favourite sword-wielding kitty cat!a lot has changed and evolved with animated films in the last decade, so naturally this film represents a huge visual upgrade over the original film.instead of taking the logical route, making everything more detailed and crisp, this film takes a stylistic approach that really pays off!every image you see just pops like paintings ready to leap off the screen.the way the film changes up the frame rate for the thrilling action sequences is not only creative, but looks absolutely phenomenal too!despite over a decade passing since antonio banderas' last outing as puss, he slips back into the boots like it was yesterday!this is arguably one of his most iconic roles, and his voice performance reminds us why...
from salma hayek's retuning character to new characters played by florence pugh and john mulaney, everyone delivers top notch voice work!wagner moura is on another level though, bringing one of dreamworks' most truly terrifying villains to life with an exceptional performance.those glowing blood coloured eyes and that spine chilling whistle...honestly nightmare fuel!with his darth maul-esque dual sickle staff, dreamworks has created the coolest villain i have ever seen in an animated film in decades!the film expertly navigates some heavy themes, like coming to terms with mortality and what it means to appreciate the life you've been given...
it's presented in a way that children will understand, but adults will truly appreciate.the lessons the characters learn are a bit predictable, but they always land with sincerity, making them effective and meaningful.overall, puss in boots the last wish is a sequel i never knew i wanted, but if this is the kind of quality and creativity this franchise is capable of, sign me up for a third film...
vibrant animation, a powerful story and excellent voice work all around prove this fan favourite character still has claws!"
"986","puss n boots","zac_la_porte",2023-01-07,8," this is actually very dark, gloomy and intense for a family movie
","this funny, charming and adorable, yet often quite dark, gloomy and intense puss in boots adventure isn't your typical cash-grabbing kids' movie. it's been over a decade since the first puss in boots movie, which was a spin-off in the shrek franchise featuring the loveable ginger cat in tiny boots wielding a mini sword. but this is unashamedly the best they've done since the first and second shrek movies.when puss in boots learns that he's already burnt through eight of his nine lives, he embarks on an epic quest to find the mythical wishing star to restore his lives. get it? because cats have nine lives? anyway, it's a pretty simple storyline that doesn't sound, and isn't really too complicated. however, this movie isn't getting all the praise for its animation techniques, vocal performances and all of that, although it definitely deserves major credit for the cast's brilliant work and the gorgeous 3d animation style that likes to pick some moments to do in a clever, witty 2d.forgivably, you can never expect a family comedy in theatres that isn't guaranteed to have its extended moments of silly humour, but these very occasional scenes don't overtake the heavy themes this movie wants to consider, which is actually life and death. there are three parties of antagonists, some who are more villainy than the others, but there's fairy tale characters goldilocks, the three bears and jack horner, and similar to the party this movie features as the protagonists, they all have meaning, struggles and thoughtful backstories to them. but it's the main villain who appears as a whistling wolf who provides the sense of dread. and when you take into consideration villain construction, appearances and overall sense of menace, he's one of the best antagonists of the year.if you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews."

","i watched this movie, mainly because i heard a lot good about it and i was blown away by a lot of things:animation: it was colorful, refreshing, energetic and stunning throughout the whole movie. especially the fighting- scenes with death were exiting to watch.charakters: i really enjoyed all of the characters; jack horner was a great, hatable villain, perrioto ( i hope i didn't misspell it) was a wholesome sidekick and i was a little shocked about his backstory üòÖ, puss in boots had a nice charakter development, kitty was also great and goldilocks was ( in my opinion) a nice character too. last but not least we have death himself, who was not just creepy and cool looking, but also a great villain with a very eerie introduction.massage: the massage this movie carried, about the fear of dying, surpriesed me and i liked how the writers put this massage so well into a kids movie. the panic-attack scene was very intense too.i hope you enjoyed the movie like i did.have a great day!"

","honestly, i wasn't expecting anything from this movie, i even hasn't expecting it thinking it would just be another sequel trying to live off the shrek franchise, it was so bad, that i even didn't bother to watch it on cinemas when it released and it wasn't until weeks after it came out that people started to talk wonders about the film. i was shocked for this reaction but the good reviews and opinions just keep coming and coming and since it was already released on streaming i decided to watch it there and it was one of the most pleasant surprises ive ever had. for starters, the animation is even better than what i was expecting, it felt so alive and unique in a very special way, the fighting scenes were some of my favourites because of this. all the characters are really good and funny, the one i liked the least was the dog, but only because i felt that the characters liked him a lot in very little time, but besides that, everyone has a good motivation, every interaction is super fun, energysing and interesting, the movie could have very well just been about the characters talking and i think i still would have had a good time. among the chacaters the death and jack horner stnd out the most, one for being absolutely terrifying and the other one for being super fun, i would love to see both of them again. so, the story, animation, characters and everything works really well in this movie it would be a 10/10 if not for the fact that there was a certain pint in the movie were i felt it got a little slow, but just a little and the fact that the dog was kidnapped over and over again kinda annoyed me, but thats it. a practically perfect movie ill watch as much as i do with shrek 2."

","i initially was drawn to this movie because of the animation style but thought it would otherwise be just okay. after hearing a few good reviews for it though, i decided to give it a go and i am so glad i did! the art style of this movie is of course so gorgeous to look at, it really needs to be seen to be fully appreciated! everything feels like it was taken right out of a fairytale storybook and the character designs do just fit into that world just perfectly! the story and characters though are what made me really fall in love with this movie. it's a very fun, action packed adventure which still finds the time to have some very heartfelt moments between the characters. not to mention the villains are some of the best i've ever seen, especially for recent times! it's funny, charming and full of wonder! i feel like this is a movie people will be talking about for a very long time!"
"995","puss n boots","popyoshi-36312",2023-02-26,10," a phenomenal movie watch it.
","a phenomenal and fun action movie with soul. this movie tells a relatively basic story but manages to make it phenomenal, despite being a kids movie as a 16 year old i found one of the villains extremely tense and almost scary to see. i obviously know nothing bad can happen but because of how they show the villain he manages to make you worry about puss in boots. there are also 2 other factions of villains who are extremely funny to watch and also have a really satisfying and relatively well told character arc. finally the film also handles its 3 protagonists and makes them all have very well told backstory's that cause a tension between characters and good chemistry at the same time. the comedy is also pretty funny not as good as the shrek films but still very well done. there are some scenes in this film that will resonate with adults in a very meaningful way and kids can learn a huge amount from this film as it teaches them how important life is. 10/10 movie highly recommend especially for kids."
"996","puss n boots","joe_jr",2022-12-28,9," better than the first. best animated movie of 2022.
","puss in boots: last wish was an incredible display of high quality storytelling and masterful script writing. besides some small critiques of the animation style and some crude humor, the film was near perfect.the storytelling was unique to the franchise and seemed genuinely inspired. the script reflects this. without giving too much away, puss learns valuable lessons, and the film itself contains a good overall moral message.the film can seem a bit dark at times with lots of comedic but somewhat frightening deaths, however some jokes are spread throughout to lighten the tone.personally, i felt the antagonistim was one of the most well written of all time. very reminiscent of the oscar winning character of anton chigurh from no country for old men.the animation was intentionally low frame rate in action scenes, however i found it worked much better in the final scenes where the frame rate was the full 24 (not 12). some might find the film anticlimactic in a few ways, but overall, most would find the movie well worth their time and money.9/10 stars!"
"997","puss n boots","drawmort",2023-01-11,8," the multilayer film that was always meant to be (the first one can be forgotten now)
","let's start by saying that this movie is the sequel to a spin-off. originality, there is no. but make no mistake, this review will be the polar opposite of the previous one, and it's all because this movie has vast improvements in every aspect. fasten your seatbelts, we're going to the land of comparisons!the general aesthetic has been completely revamped and changed to separate itself from the saga that was born. other than the characters (and something in the end), there's nothing here that comes close to shrek or the first puss in boots movie. what there are are layers and layers of colorful landscapes, anime movements, well-grounded humor, absurd humor, children's humor and even for each character there is a lesson behind it, don't forget that after all, this is a fairy tale.the really great thing about this film is that it's a multi-layered work, which makes it suitable for all audiences. however, the most salvageable is the lesson that remains for the film industry itself: it doesn't matter to wait more than ten years to make a sequel, as long as it's well done. let's forget about the hamburger factory. this should always be so.separate point, did you notice the movie references? there are many, but my favorites are two: one of james cameron's movies and another one of the most popular movie of just last year.get ready because this will be the new animation style from now on."
"998","puss n boots","kenc-05236",2022-12-27,8," a whimsical charming movie
","for me this movie is in between a 7 and a 8 but i gave it a 8 because i want to see it do well. this movie was surprisingly good considering the first was ok and released about a decade ago but they somehow naturally built upon that movie and made this.the way puss tackles his mortality was was really, especially with the death character (my absolute favorite character in the movie, along with jiminy cricket). the way they portrayed death was just excellent from the voice, to the design, to his fight scenes with those sickles. with the intro fight it really does set the tone for the rest of the movie with him having puss on the run.along with puss the other characters are also great. every character has a well defined insecurity (idk if that's the right word) minus the dog but he's seems to be happy to care so whatever. then the other main villain is just so fun with all his fairy tale weapons everything is just creative and well written."

","what is to say that hasn't already been praised about this movie?the two villains are incredible, especially the side villain. it's refreshing to have a straight main villain. no lame tragic or misunderstood villains like in disney (even lack of villains). just a classic villain.the b plot with goldilocks and her bear family was great. i suspect it was to make the movie feel more full, otherwise it would've felt too empty with only jack horner versus puss.puss's side characters were great. i thought the dog was going to be an annoying adhd character but he's got depth.90% of the jokes land. the pacing is brisk. didn't realize it was almost 2 hours because it was so engaging. the driving theme of the story is excellent and well handled and not too in your face.please don't let this gem miss you."

"1001","puss n boots","i_ailurophile",2023-03-11,10," perfection. one of the greatest cinematic spectacles in recent memory, bar none.
","with one smart, imaginative, funny, oddball film, 2001's 'shrek' become an overnight sensation and birthed a franchise that even with imperfections, and arguably diminishing returns, has been an anchor for animated features. 2004's 'shrek 2' was just as swell, and further notable for introducing the world to the movie universe's own version of puss in boots. dashing, swashbuckling, completely adorable, and as skilled in song and dance as he is in adventure, the purring rogue instantly won the hearts of one and all, and demonstrated why with his own 2011 spin-off. fast forward eleven years, and immediately upon its release this long-awaited sequel was met with substantial popular and critical acclaim, and earned award nominations left and right. i've been very much looking forward to this, and i've not been disappointed. in fact, despite having had enormous expectations built up for me, those expectations have still been well surpassed. we can only hope that 'the last wish' isn't truly the title character's last, because this is an outstanding, fabulously well made and written feature that deserves all its immense esteem, and more where that came from.there's little mistaking that this 2022 picture takes inspiration from the true best picture of 2018, 'spider-man: into the spiderverse,' in the new vision for its animation style. one emphatically recognizes the same ethos blending digital 3d rendering with the sensibilities of 2d illustrations. there, it was comic books; here, storybooks. despite such clear influence, this feature unquestionably strikes a chord all its very own, deftly blending the two aspects with a dazzling finesse that makes it feel brand new all over again. even returning characters, like the protagonist and kitty softpaws, feel brand new all over again. every environment and active visual element rides a fabulous line between almost believably real, and uncanny and unnatural, inherently making this an absolute joy to watch. this is to say nothing of the fundamental design of all such facets; the backgrounds and settings are gorgeous, every creature and character are downright inventive (the wolf, above all, is a stroke of genius in every way), and every effect and action sequence is made all the richer and more exciting with such an explosion of vibrancy and color.speaking of action, as one should assume 'the last wish' is bursting at the seams with it, and it's genuinely thrilling. but rip-roaring vigor is far from the only domain in which this whimsy dabbles, as the feature whips together an astonishing treasure trove of this, that, and everything. in 2022 this 'puss in boots' brought back the tremendous intelligence, wit, heart, and humor that the 'shrek' films possessed at their best, and frankly seems to do it all even better. jokes and gags connected to the characters' kitty constitutions (and likewise, the core nature of other bits and bobs), nevermind the signature feline power move; a myriad plethora of fairy tales, folklore, and legends blended into one expansive world, and twisted to delightful new ends; a terrific range of humor from the low and boorish, to situational humor and sight gags, to splendidly sharp dialogue, to puns and references, to abject silliness, and more; admirable, impactful themes, and possibly more earnest soul than any of this title's predecessors could claim; real, full-fledged characters - we get all this, and then some. a stellar cast give excellent performances, to the point that i wonder when the last time was that antonio banderas, salma hayek, florence pugh, john mulaney, olivia colman, wagner moura, harvey guill√©n, or anyone else has had this much fun. kevin mccann almost threatens to steal the show with voice work that, to my unremitting pleasure, decidedly mimics one endlessly affable star of years past.the fundamental look and feel of puss in boots' world has surely never been so boundlessly fanciful, and everyone working to bring this to life give us bounteous dreamscapes that are a major treat for us viewers. that same brainpower is extended to every last facet of this production. in this moment, i'm hard-pressed to think of a significant number of other pictures that have been so exquisitely far-sighted and far-reaching in their vivid creativity, while also being so wholeheartedly sincere, and so marvelously entertaining. music, editing, direction, voice acting, sound design and effects, the writing; from the wild opening scene to the utterly brilliant climax and the deeply satisfying ending - this comes across from top to bottom as the type of unswerving, perfect, complete cinematic spectacle that is exactly why we go to the movies in the first place. all those filmmakers, producers, actors, critics, and cinephiles who have ever spoken effusively of the power of the medium, and their adoration of movies, may have had particular titles in mind when they did so. i quite believe 'the last wish' will, or at least should, be heralded as one such title in the years to come. this is simply exemplary.we can hope this isn't the swashbuckler's last outing, but if it is, it's the best possible ending to his celluloid saga. once more, i had high expectations when i sat to watch - how could i not, all things considered? - and still i'm totally blown away. this is ""far, far away"" not just the best animated feature of 2022, but one of the very best pictures, period. the rest of the shrek-verse can't compare; precious little can. i am stunned. i am flabbergasted. i'm totally in love. it doesn't matter whether you're specifically a fan of the character or his animated friends, fairy tales or just films generally: for one and all, this is a must-see extravaganza, a new high water mark of quality for animation and perhaps for cinematic storytelling overall. well over one hundred years since the advent of motion pictures, and still creative minds find new ways again and again to astound and bedazzle. i can only thank dreamworks, filmmaker joel crawford, the cast, the artists, and everyone else who in any way helped to realize 'puss in boots: the last wish,' for this is unfailingly magnificent. bravo!"

"1003","puss n boots","eciekyle",2022-12-18,9," nuanced narrative and characterizations of side characters and especially the protagonist and antagonist. entertaining, well choreographed, and fantastic cinematography
","i really love puss' characterization and development in this movie. he is a fearless and brave individual and he found identity in that. but in most ways, he took it for granted. he lived a life where his 9 lives were disposable, where there was no true value in them, until his final one.so, when the doctor confronted him on the reality of the situation, he hated it. mocked it even. he's the fearless puss in boots after all. what would his life be if he wasn't living in danger? but only when confronted by a bounty hunter coming after his life, and being completely overwhelmed in battle, where he truly realizes the reality and value of his 1 singular life.and this part of the movie gave me literal chills. the animation and visual team did an amazing job showing puss' despair, with his hair standing up as it slowly reaches to his face, and how he was willing to go through a toilet to save himself. the lengths he was willing to take to live is so reflective of what humans would do to live, sometimes even doing morally evil things too.he wasn't fearless, he was full of fear. he wasn't puss in boots, he was a scaredy cat.puss has a traumatic experience from that throughout the entire movie, with the wolf's signature whistle being a huge trigger for him, and it's such a menacing way of introducing him into the scene too.speaking of the wolf, he's such a menacing and terrifying antagonist. his presence and character design are great, but what makes him so scary is his visual portrayal mixed with the voice acting. the movie wasn't afraid to not cater to kids and to not be limited by that. which is a problem i have with some films, where mature themes aren't done to the fullest potential due to limitations. the way he effortlessly dodges puss' attacks and instills fear into him is so memorable and impactful.puss being haunted by the fear of death is something we need to take into consideration too in our lives. people love to live in the present, but also don't see the biggest problem of death right in front of us. we rather not think about it because it's such a scary reality. so, when life hits us, we're like puss facing the reality of death for the first time. we're vulnerable and afraid. and not everyone tells people about how they're feeling. some people keep it to themselves, which is what puss did throughout the movie till he shows vulnerability and expresses his fears to perro the dog.even the most powerful people will still succumb to the fear of death when reality hits them.goldilocks and the 3 bears were also amazing characters, where she was seeking for the wishing star because she doesn't have an ordinary family. by ""just right"", she wanted and craved for a human family. she used her foster family as steppingstones to reach her goal of replacing them, which is so tragic because she faces an issue of envy. when a person is clouded with envy, they aren't grateful for what they have, and would do what they can to obtain what they don't have.i also love the build up to the eventual reveal of her wish. her appreciating the simpler times with the bears in their house was so heart-warming. it's the small things that often go unappreciated, like how she would hold this fairy tale book as a child wherever she would go, sleeping on comfy bed, drinking soup with her foster family, and so on. sometimes, you just have to stop and take a look around you. you have a house to live that house's memories. you have food and water. you have transport to go to different places. you have photos with your families and friends that you can reminisce. you can even go beyond that and just admire the complexities of the world. how trees give you shade when it's a sunny day, or how the sky has a pleasing and calming colour, and even animals and how unique they all are.there are a lot more aspects that i really love about this movie but i'll stop right here. i definitely recommend watching it. not only is it narratively nuanced, but the pacing of the movie is also good. cinematography and choreography of the fights are so well done too, which is one benefit of the movie being 2.5d."

","i had no idea that this sequel to a decade old movie was being released until i kept seeing people saying this movie was great. of course, being english, i had to wait until february to see it. avoiding spoilers was hard enough from the americans, so i made sure i saw this movie as soon as i could once it released in the uk, and i was surprised that even though this movie was sold to me as amazing, it still exceeded my expectations!the story was a ""reach the goal first"" type between the team of puss in boots, kitty softpaws, and perrito the dog, the team of goldilocks and the three bears crime family, and then big jack horner and his baker's dozen. each has a reason to get to the wishing star first, and so the stakes and motives are set up very well. additionally, puss in boots, at his last life, is being haunted by death (in the form of a big bad wolf), which gives the movie a chance to explore anxiety quite well.this movie contains various types of villains and serves each quite well. goldilocks and the three bears serve as the redeemable villains, as goldi's wish is to find a new family, but she soon realises that all she needed was the three bears. next, the irredeemable villain of jack horner. i'd never heard of jack horner before, but they explained his story pretty well, gave him a story as to why he was evil, and the back and forth between jack and the ethical bug shows just how bad he is, but also serves for fun comedy. and then there's death, who follows a sort of horror villain blueprint of relentlessly chasing down the protagonist until they reach an inevitable final confrontation.my main complaint about the movie was that some aspects felt a bit predictable. it became clear that goldilocks was after a real family so you knew she would inevitably give that up to stay with the bears. jack horner obviously couldn't get the wish, as that would've been this movie's equivalent of the thanos snap. the fact that no one got the wish in the end was a surprise though. and seeing jack get so close just to be stopped by the ethical bug was honestly perfect. however, back onto the predictability, as soon as death mentioned that puss lived carelessly, throwing lives away, it was quite obvious that puss would learn to use his life well and that would result in death conceding in battle. death obviously couldn't be killed, as he's, well, death! and killing puss, as shocking as that would have been, would never have happened in a movie with the primary target audience being children.it must be mentioned though that this movie's animation was amazing, the comedy was on point in the right places, the themes of this movie were executed well, and somehow, this movie has exceeded most of what disney's been producing in recent times. would love to see more animated movie with this level of storytelling!a solid 8/10 from this reviewer."

","dreamworks animation is a studio with a mixed track record, they will give you something like 'shrek' or the kung fu panda films, but just as easily, and probably more frequently, you get 'the boss baby' and 'trolls' films.so, when 'puss in boots: the last wish' was announced, i wasn't particularly excited for another instalment in the already bloated 'shrek' franchise, but then, i watched the trailer, and something about this film seemed different, so i kept a sense of cautious optimism.after watching the film, i can say that it blew me away, as someone how isn't a massive fan of the 'shrek' films, 'the last wish' is stunning, and easily dreamworks' best film to date.the film follows puss in boots who discovers that he has used eight of nine lives and decides to go into retirement, until his dangerous past catches up with him.firstly, this film's animation is breathtaking, by clearly taking ques 'spider-man: into the spider-verse', this film takes a more stylised approach to its animation, as opposed to the clean, washed out cgi style plaguing modern animated films. despite being inspired by 'spider-verse', this film's art style is completely its own, while 'spider-verse' took great efforts to look like a comic book in motion, 'the last wish' feels more inspired by pulp graphic novels, but the fluidity in the characters' movements are sensational and the backgrounds bleed personality.the film's story, while simple and initially feeling a bit 'mcguffin-y', deals with several dark, mature themes. the pacing is perfect, and each story feels equally divided and important, the characters are fantastically likeable (or unlikeable, in the case of 'big' jack horner, played by the incredible john mullaney, who, bizarrely was in 'spider-verse' too) and the humour is incredibly funny, there are scenes in this film that feel iconic the moment you see them.the direction by joel crawford is sensational, he provides some of the greatest action scenes ever animated, and the opening sequence is flat-out perfection. the voice acting is incredible, antonio bandars is as perfect as always as puss, selma hayek is also great and john mullaney proves that his 'spider-verse' performance wasn't a flook, and maybe gives the film's best performance. harvey guillen and florence pugh both deserve mentions too.the editing is fast, but precise, and the score is stunning, with the ballad 'fearless hero' bound to get stuck in viewers' heads for days.overall, this film is easily dreamworks' best ever film in my opinion, it has so much charm, humour, heart and artistic value, i would love to see the studio continue in this direction and the animation industry in general and create more age-defying masterpieces that entertain everyone for various reasons."

","puss in boots: the last wish has as its theme death and conquering fear. after so many adventures, puss has only one life left and embarks on a journey to make a magic wish to restore his nine lives. a journey not only physical but also introspective between puss and the legend of puss in boots.i've never seen anxiety and fear portrayed so well as in this movie. that disorder that causes fear and uneasiness ails puss when he's conscious of his mortality, his finitude. the physical impossibility of death in the mind of someone living. the calm of the static before a life of adventures, adrenaline, and that retirement that for someone like this, if that fear prevails, could mean death in life. we are born to die, but we can find a purpose, and for the figure of the hero few things mean more than the transformation from fearless to brave.besides kitty softpaws in this sequel, we get to know perrito who is much more than the sidekick he seems to be at first sight. the character development is impeccable. not only are they loveable, but also fun, and with interesting backstories to tell. it's easy to relate to them. we're also introduced to whom could be regarded as one of the best antagonist of an animated dremworks movie that steals every scene that he's in. the pacing is excellent; it doesn't have a single moment that feels a filler. when it comes to the visuals, the creators chose for the action scenes animations that distances from the real for something more fantastic and graphic-novel-style. this gives it a different touch in the shrek universe. the shrek saga, for me, is the definition of a family movie. behind all the laughter there were always profound elements, especially in shrek forever after. puss in boots: the last wish is also like that. something tells me adults are going to enjoy it more than the kids. disney's sould is also in this category. i love that.i've already seen it two times, and definitely they're not going to be the last because it's enjoyable from beginning to end. it's on the level of the best of shrek and dreamworks."

, this presented me with genuine story with a complex narrative. throughout the movie death comes for puss in boots, specifically in times where he himself is close to dying, death gives puss in boots genuine fear that encourages him to seek more out of life. puss in boots realised that life is fleeting and that he'll have to make the most of what he has, he learns real life lessons that the majority of adults have trouble with and these difficult topics are met with just the right tone and seriousness while keeping it kid-friendly.this is a movie i would happily recommend to anyone regardless of age because it is genuinely a great film in and of itself."

"1018","puss n boots","jamjohnx3",2023-04-03,9," a dreamworks renaissance
","admittedly, i stopped paying too much attention to dreamworks' animated slate in the mid-2010's, especially when trolls and the boss baby rolled around, but it's pretty clear between puss in boots: the last wish and the bad guys that something has recently changed. call it a shake up, a shot in the arm, or a renaissance, but they've put the competition on notice with a duo of movies that are heartfelt, funny, well-written, and visually exquisite.the last wish comes over ten years after the first puss in boots movie, but it honestly doesn't matter. the only thing i really remember from the first movie was humpty dumpty's nightmare fuel-inducing human face. tlw is written in a way that makes it easy to get into the plot and characters without having watched the first puss in boots movie or even any of the shreks.in this movie, puss is continuing his adventures, saving towns and spreading his legend when he dies after fighting a giant. luckily for him, cats have nine lives, but the local doctor tells him that he's down to his ninth and final life after losing the previous eight in reckless and frivolous scenarios. puss is barely fazed by this news until he's attacked in a bar by a sickle-wielding wolf that nearly kills him. puss is so badly shaken that he retires at an elderly woman's home for cats. puss's salvation comes in the form of the wishing star - whoever finds it can wish for what they want most, and puss can get his lives back. problem is, everybody else wants the star too. jack horner has the map to the star, and it's also being pursued by puss's ex, kitty softpaws, as well as goldilocks and the three bears crime family. rounding out the cast is perrito the eccentric puppy, who could have fallen into the annoying sidekick trap but ends up being one of the biggest sources of emotion in the movie. with the wolf stalking puss to finish what he started, it becomes a rat race to see who can get the wish first, but ultimately ends up being something much more mature and satisfying by the end.this movie is a masterclass in pretty much everything it does, but the two standouts for me are the visuals and writing. tlw takes cues from into the spiderverse with kinetic, sometimes low framerate action sequences. this can sound jarring for someone that hasn't seen this before, but it absolutely works in execution. the art style is something else completely, going for a fairy tale-esque painterly look. i imagine there will be a lot of freeze frames from the digital release, because this movie looks that stunning. i saw screenshots i actually thought were concept art until i actually watched the movie. the updated character designs shouldn't go unnoticed either; returning characters are instantly recognized but tweaked in a way that just makes them look so much better than the sometimes-ugly photorealism from the older shrek movies.the characters really deliver here. there are three antagonistic forces, and of the three, only jack horner is actually a villain, and he straddles of line between despicable and hilarious throughout the movie. the wolf is cool and oddly charismatic even when he's traumatizing puss. goldilocks has a sympathetic backstory that tugs on the heartstrings. perhaps the biggest surprise to me was puss himself. puss in boots is not a character that i thought needed to experience growth and vulnerability, but i'm so glad they went there and elevated this character. there's been a lot of dropped balls when it comes to character writing in recent animated movies - watching puss experience introspection and grow through the journey was such a breath of fresh air after sing 2 doubled down on making buster moon a con artist that gets rewarded for lying and cheating, and instead of having that character learn from and own up to his mistakes, they introduced and wasted jimmy crystal as a scapegoat ""villain"" that ends up suffering the brunt of the audience's hate for a conflict he didn't even create. puss's development actually respects the audience and sends the message to kids that what we want isn't necessarily the same thing as what we need.there's no such thing as a perfect movie but there are movies whose flaws are so minor they aren't worth mentioning. i have a good feeling this movie is going to stay in my rotation. it's a modern classic, and i want to see this level of energy, inspiration and ingenuity keep coming out of the big animation studios. it pretty much flies in the face of arguments that insists that animation is only for children, or that animation studios shouldn't even try to make great movies."

","besides the presence of kitty, i could've been convinced that there was no puss in boots 1. the sequel is closer to standalone than direct. and more than just being different story-wise, puss in boots is not even close to the same movie as the first one. for starters, the animation is really creative. it takes a page out of spider-verse to look intentionally choppy at times by messing with the frame rate to give it a comic-like feel. to aid this, the art in this movie is incredible. some things are more abstract than realistic, there are beautiful colors that contrast, and there's tons of creative scenery. it almost feels like the creative team made beautiful paintings and tried to build a movie out of it rather than make a movie and then fill in the scenery, which works really well here. next, the movie is way darker. it's plenty funny like all dreamworks movies, but whereas the original was entirely fun, this one was very dark. the wolf villain, in particular, was one of the scariest villains of the year. the dark aesthetic, the voice acting, the uncanny whistle and soundtrack, and the camerawork all created fear perfectly. he was probably my favorite part. also like all dreamworks movies, it's sweet and heartwarming. the only downside of this movie is that, besides the animation, nothing blows me away. it's not as funny as the bad guys, as heartwarming as how to train your dragon, or as action-packed as kung fu panda. everything about it is good but not great. but the brilliant animation gets an otherwise decent movie to become nearly perfect."

","today i watched a shrek sequel and it was very goodyeah, this movie was a complete shocker to me as i really didn't expect anything from it going in. but uh yeah this movie really does have everything going for it, it's funny, it has a lot of really intense action, there's actual stakes which doesn't feel like the case in most kids movies, and it has a really charming unique personality to it.if there's anything that i didn't like from the movie, it would really have to be the mixing in the opening of the movie. it felt like pickles wasn't properly mixed into the scene, and i really could not hear half of the words he was saying, thankfully this only really went on through the first maybe 10-15 minutes of the film, basically when the opening stops. besides that you can make an argument that there are clich√© and predictable elements to this film. there was one instance when i noticed pickles literally change sizes between scenes and then it never happened again, it was during a fight scene near the beginning where he got tossed around.however, though its story structure is predictable, this is reductive a bit. it's a three act structure with a typical ending you'd see in 1000 movies till this point, but the way that the movie goes to reach this point feels like it's own unique true journey. every character reaches their logical end in such a satisfying fashion, it's easy to overlook that. the story basically perfectly led to the ending and didn't really leave me feeling like i could ask for more in that regard from a modern day shrek sequel.this film genuinely feels like characters are in real danger. it feels like every character, no matter how small or big, has a distinct personality and look to them, and they can absolutely die. that feels really good in a movie to feel like there's a real challenge to overcome, something this movie does excellently. the villains feel like real villains and are actually pretty menacing, showing a real threat within the story to the main characters. also i cannot tell you how nice it is to have a comic relief character be pivotal to the story and not annoying. seriously it's so common and annoying(i'll never forgive you treasure planet üò¢)the film looks absolutely gorgeous. it's like a pastel paradise of colors. the animation is smooth when it needs to be and stylistically choppy during intense pivotal points. all of the characters look fantastic and stylistically distinct from the other cgi art styles i've seen in the past. each character is immediately recognizable as their own. i want to pet the dog.the action scenes are so dang well executed. it doesn't feel to abnormally fluid and i feel this to be assisted by the intentionally choppy animation style during these scenes. they also use comic book style action lines to emphasize certain movements and to drag your eyes to what they want you to focus on. the bad guys did something like this basically but i feel that this movie really improves upon that style.overall, i could spend a long time talking about how awesome and surprising this movie was for me. it was genuinely great, and probably my favorite shrek movie. isn't that a funny thing to say, your favorite shrek movie is a puss n boots sequel. please watch this movie it's very good. it's tremendously funny too btw.high 8/10."

","eric's grade: b
'puss in boots: the last wish' is the sixth overall film in the shrek universe and the sequel to the 2011 spinoff 'puss in boots'. joel crawford directs in only his second feature film also helming the croods sequel from 2020. he previously worked as a story artists on a decent amount of high profile animated projects including other shrek films as well as the kung fu panda series among others. antonio banderas and salma hayek pinault return reprising their voice roles from the previous films. new additions to the cast include florence pugh, olivia colman, ray winstone and harvey guillen. a sequel to 'puss in boots' had been in development as far back as 2012, but it languished in development hell before finally being resurrected in 2018. 'puss in boots: the last wish' became a commercial and critical success taking in over $480 million in worldwide box office and it received an academy award nomination for best animated feature.puss is on his last life and thus seeks the mythical last wish in order to reset his nine lives and stave off death a little longer. he is being pursued by a dark, homicidal wolf full of malevolent intent. along the way he gets tangled up once more with kitty softpaws with whom he now shares some interesting and significant history. he also gains a sidekick in the form of a dog named perrito who is hilarious throughout and responsible for most of the best comedic moments in the film. there are others seeking the last wish as well including goldilocks and the three bears, and a completely crazy ""big"" jack horner. they all, of course, come to a final showdown for the titular object and this being an endearing family animated feature it is not too much of a stretch to see how it all will turn out.while it has been ten years this sequel picks up without missing a beat, and not only that, it hints at a potential shrek adventure for yet another possible sequel. the film uses an interesting animation style sort of in the wheelhouse of 'into the spider-verse' although not quite that chaotic. it is meant to evoke the fairy tale feel more and i think it works well, and if i didn't find it endearing i certainly did not think it was offputting. the writing also channels the spaghetti westerns of sergio leonne, and puss, as a character, works well in that western style. the best new addition was the little dog perrito. sometimes those comic relief characters can feel out of place and/or be downright annoying but perrito is hilarious and really gels their little team together. other new additions such as goldilocks and the bears as well as jack horner were fine. the story could have been better as it was a tad on the predicable side, but they did excel in the execution of their story. this was a nice, fun, funny installment in the shrek/puss series of films which are almost always a good time. hopefully this reinvigorates the franchise and we'll see another fairy tale adventure soon."

","honestly, it really does feel like it has been an awfully long time between drinks with regards to the shrek universe, even taking into account the puss in boots spinoff movie. then again a part of me suspects that actors have all gone on to do other things, and in the case of mike meyers, has pretty much entered into semi-retirement (though he still comes back from time to time). while i would suggest that this latest edition to the franchise holds out hope for the future, sometimes i feel that maybe it is time to put some franchises to rest.anyway, the story opens with mention of the wishing star, a shooting star that crashed and pretty much transformed an entire forest. it is said that whoever finds the star will be granted a wish, which sort of suggests that wishes are no doubt very, very rare in this world. however, that aside, puss suddenly learns that he has lost all but one of his lives, and decides to go into retirement, namely at a cattery that is being run by and old lady. however, goldilocks and the three bears rock up looking for puss, believing that he is the only person who can steal the map to the wishing star, and as such he decides to leave retirement because it sees it as a way of getting his lives back.i guess the idea behind the film is that the quest for a wish may actually be futile because that which we desire we no doubt already have. honestly, sometimes i do wonder if this is because the world of the films, and the world that they seem to be sending their messages to, is pretty much an idealistic world because honestly, there are a lot of people out there that a wish to transform their lives would be a godsend.yet i guess in some cases there are those of us that actually don't really realise what we actually have until it is all gone. we do pursue these goals and go on these quests that really only result in wasted time because, well, as it turns out everything that we could have wanted is actually right there in front of us. actually, i guess it is the idea of contentment, and is being content with what we have. that is pretty much exemplified by the dog because, well, throughout the film he says that he doesn't want a wish because everything he could wish for he already has - warm clothing and friends. the ironic thing is that despite people trying to say that they are not his friends, he still pretty much views them as his friends.yeah, look, i have to say that it wasn't bad. in many ways it simply seems to be continuing along the theme of the original shrek films, but is also introducing new actors since the many of the original ones are getting pretty old. however, being an animated film it does help because the characters don't age in the way that the voice actors age. anything, yeah, it's not bad entertainment, though it still very much follows the road set out in the original shrek film."

","puss in boots: the last wish (2022) review -puss in boots: the last wish serves as a sequel to chris miller's spin-off puss in boots, which was born out of shrek's pandora box. i haven't been a huge fan of the shrek franchise except for the first film, and moreover, miller's spin-off didn't suit me either. but now, after watching joel crawford's sequel, i might want to join the fan club of puss in boots. sometimes a sequel exceeds expectations and sets a benchmark, and puss in boots 2 has done exactly that. unlike many other animated sequels, puss in boots: the last wish comes with the promise of cinematic expansion in many aspects, be it characters, storyline, or visuals.puss in boots: the last wish follows puss in boots (antonio banderas), who has finally started to fear something, and it's none other than 'death' (a wolf). he starts living a boring and eventless life in a cathouse. as the last hope, he goes on a journey to find the mystical last wish for the wishing star. puss teams up with his old friend (girlfriend) kitty softpaws (salma hayek) and the little dog from the cathouse, perrito (harvey guill√©n), to restore the eight of his nine lives that he lost while escaping fellow outlaws goldilocks (florence pugh) and big jack horner (john mulaney), who are also trying to reach the star.tommy swerdlow and tom wheeler's story has both brains and heart, while paul fisher, as a co-screenwriter, puts a soul into it. practically, a film is supposed to be imaginative, especially if it's an animated feature flick. isn't puss in boots 2 a perfect example of imagination with a perfect blending of life lessons? yes, it is. you know, some netizens say that dreamworks is cracking the pixar formula in their own style. i guess it's true. an adventure drama with emotions and a beautiful message indicates so. i should give credit to the writers and screenwriters for enhancing the viewing experience with their skills. they say half the battle is won on paper; here is the reason why they say it. there is something for everyone of all age groups, which doesn't happen with every animation film you know.the big voice cast of antonio banderas, salma hayek pinault, harvey guill√©n, florence pugh, olivia colman, ray winstone, samson kayo, john mulaney, wagner moura, da'vine joy randolph, and anthony mendez is sweet with outcomes and different dialects. that's one of the easiest jobs in the world of animation, but it has to be done carefully. some characters are too sweet here, which is unacceptable, but of course, how can someone hate the positivity? even if it's too difficult to believe. nevertheless, there is a message behind it, and it's not that intricate to understand. you are gonna enjoy that process and the results that follow.dreamworks almost hit a hundred dollar budget for the sequel that was late for its generation of audience, leaving everyone worried about the profits. well, i must say, they spent where it was due. puss in boots: the last wish is one of the most stunning visual spectacles ever produced by dreamworks animation for under $100 million. the action sequences are breathtaking, and the 3d effects are marvelous. animation doesn't really require 3d viewing unless you have something special to show. here, you have that something special coming in the first 10 minutes only. also, the middle and climax portions of the film are visually gorgeous.i wished for a better use of the background score, which remained average. the editing is misjudged in the first half but pretty smooth in the latter half of the film. joel crawford is just 5 years old as a director with 3 films in his kitty, and puss in boots 2 suddenly takes him to the next level. this is, by far, his best work till date, and i am excited to see how ""far far away"" he goes in the future. as a whole, puss in boots: the last wish is a perfect family film for the holiday period; however, indians have to see it almost a month later. does it really matter as long as you are spending the money on something that is worth it?rating - 7/10*"

","puss in boots proved itself to be the most impressionable installment in the shrek film series. after what i've seen in the 2011 spin-off prequel, its follow-up the last wish really runs deep in to a more complex story with mature themes thrown into the mix. like it still has its humor, charm, and lighthearted moments as before, but one thing that sets it off differently is the themes of mortality playing an integral part in puss' life and the story.well over a decade later after his last adventure (and shortly after the events of shrek forever after), puss always proved to be the charmer, showboater, and all-around feline with his fancy boots, hat, and sword who thinks he can do no wrong even scoffing at the face of danger and death with all of his skills. however, upon learning that he is mortal after losing eight of his nine lives in the past and up until recently, puss begins to question if he is truly worthy as the legend and he will need the fabled wishing star to set him straight.antonio banderas reprises his role with yet another great performance as well as the return of salma hayek as kitty softpaws. marking their sixth movie together, they balance each other out well with both wittiness and passion. their latest companion perrito (played by what we do in the shadow's star harvey guillen) is good for wisecracks and his enthusiastic sense of humor. much different from zach galifinakis' humpty dumpty in the 2011 film. the animation style is rather unique and was implemented here as it was with academy award-winning film spider-man: into the spider-verse. it's different from the photorealistic themes used before, but how it's used in the fight sequences gives off a storybook, painting-like feel and i admire that design.now what had me thinking really carefully was the white wolf stalking puss. for him to be revealed as death itself and the thought about mortality being so prominent in puss' life, it became rather meaningful during the duel between them. and that dagger he wielded to outsmart death is a form of symbolism. puss knew he can't escape death, but with all these fears and uncertainties plaguing his one life left, he overcame it with the one thing that never came to mind: love.i actually heard a few audience members in my local auditorium quietly weeping over puss' predicament and melancholy demeanor. i now see why awards season acknowledges this dreamworks animated film. left me intrigued and fascinated over what lies ahead next for him and his companions."

subduing an earthen giant. waking up, he is informed by a doctor that he only has one life after burning through his past eight and suggests he immediately retire from adventuring. well puss doesn't and the rest of the movie concerns comical events as he goes on a journey to find the mystical last wish for the wishing star so that he can restore the eight of his nine lives that he lost while escaping new enemies.i've seen too many good animated flicks to go deep into analyzing this one. in short seasoned movie fans won't find this one amusing. i enjoyed paws of fury: the legend of hank more than this one."

","i mean, it is possibly the best film of the year along with everything everywhere all at once.first things first, the story highly reminded me of the first shrek movie: a protagonist living his life unaware of what is missing, later on having to find meaning of his life with an animal sidekick and love of his life. practically, that is the plot of shrek as well as of this film's.but i really, really enjoyed watching it. i did not get bored, i was hooked. john mulaney was a nice surprise as i did not read about the casting before i watched it, he really entertains as usual.do i even have to talk about the main cast?! banderas and hayek are great. the bears are also great. the only so-much-so negative thing is pugh's performance. it was like out of place for some reason.even though you can see the ending just reading the title, it really entertains.the best animation of the year definitely, though. cliffhanger at the end i hope pays off very very soon as i really would love to see a reunion."

","so i had low expectations for this because sequels typically don't live up to the originals but i was really blown away with how good this was! it had a plethora of funny disney and nursery rhyme mentions and the movie never got boring to me. there was however some cursing like hell and crap that i wasn't expecting so heads up on that for the kids and there's a wolf character i thought was a tad scary for little kids too but i felt despite those things they were trying to reach out to both kids and adults for this film and in the end i felt was quite successful. the graphics have an into the spiderverse feel during fight scenes which is different yet fun and the message about friendship and family was great for kids but also had a deeper meaning for adults about reflections on your time on earth and what you would've done differently and what would you do if you had the chance to change it. great film go see it!"

","here is my review of puss in boots: the last wish. i am genuinely blown away by how much i loved it. i will start off by mentioning how good the animation is. holy cow it is superb and just beautiful to look at. the animation also accompanies the fantastic action to make it all the better. i watched it in spanish so it didn't have the all of the same voice actors, besides banderas and probably salma hayek, but everyone did an excellent job, especially from the main two i just mentioned. the fact that puss in boots only has one life left gives the story a lot more emotion than i was anticipating. this also gives way for themes about death, enjoying life while it lasts, making the most of it, and accepting your fate. the wolf is shown to be a frightening and threatening presence that for once makes puss afraid, he not only gave puss chills but gave me chills every single time he was on screen. the moments where we see puss fearing death are arguably the most effective and emotional. all in all, this is easily my favorite animated movie of the year and maybe the biggest surprise of the year as well."
"1055","puss n boots","calebbrookscj",2022-12-31,10," this had no reason to be this good
","puss in boots finally comes out 11 years after we we last saw the lovable el gato's adventure and let's just say that (puss in boots:the last wish) is everything that we wanted in the sequel for the legend himself. the animation is out of this world, with the film prioritizing a similar style like ""spider-man:into the spider-verse(2018) and the bad guys (2022). the story is a great improvement from the first film with puss given a huge amount of character development that allows conflict to subside with his personality that remains after the first film while allowing every character to tackle serious/darker topics that doesn't conflict with it's comedic tone. the film even carry's over a hilarious amount of comedy that is familiar from the first shrek film."

","it doesn't even feel right to be referring to this movie as a ""kid's movie"" to be honest; it's much more.i absolutely loved shrek as a kid and puss was one of my favorite characters. i even loved the original puss movie with all of it's flaws but this is next level.this isn't your average animated film. it's smart, funny, charming, and has some real adult themes throughout. puss, kitty, perrito, even goldi and the 3 bears all had real character motivations that adults and kids alike can sympathize with. wanting a family, wanting someone that you can trust, being afraid of the end are all emotions everyone has felt one time or another.i feel like i almost never find ""kids"" movies funny but this movie genuinely has some good comedy. it's just really charming which helps a lot. i also really enjoyed kitty and puss's relationship in this a lot and how they bounced off of each other really well.i enjoyed the entire cast as a whole but two people really stood out. antonio banderas and wagner moura both phone in great performances as puss and death. you really get the feeling antonio loves to play as puss.you can probably tell but i absolutely love this movie. i'm not a big animated movie fan but i've always had a thing for the ones with adult themes behind them such as the kung fu panda and how to train your dragon movies. i just like good storytelling and this movie delivers that. i can't recommend it highly enough."

","so i i saw this in a cinema with my son, who now rates this as his favourite movie.i was drifting off to sleep in the theatre until the wolf appeared. what a character. genuinely up there with the likes of the joker and darth vader as a supremely chilling super-villain.i was then captivated by the depth of the animation, switching seamlessly between comic book (almost spider verse) styling and typical dreamworks animation, it really is the best animation i have seen from a mainstream production company.no spoilers here, yet the story becomes engrossing if a little scattered between the various competing 'baddies', who never really seem to tie together. i'm also annoyed by florence pugh voicing goldilocks as some sort of cockney market trader. the accent doesn't fit the character.overall, enjoyable, and look out for the wolf who is awesome!"
"1060","puss n boots","dormancyx",2023-01-17,6," best shrek sequel since shrek 2?
","came for the reviews, wasn't disappointed. appealing usage of color, enjoyable reconfiguration of fairy tales, and interesting choice of voice actresses. the action sequences are definitely the highlight of this movie, as all of camera work, animation, and choreography work spotlessly, comparable to some of the best fight scenes from attack on titan or naruto shippuden. utilizing reflections of eyes, crystal, and the map, the thematic idea of introspection, especially in the face of death, is also brough up, which unfortunately isn't emphasized enough to be memorable. much of the narration and pacing in the second act is diluted and essentially ruined by the multiple perspectives and excessive characters. however, the major antagonist, death, is honestly a compelling figure: menacing, dogged, yet chivalrous."

"1062","puss n boots","horst_in_translation",2022-12-28,6," still alive after all these years
","""puss in boots: the last wish"" is an american animated movie from 2022, so really new and fresh and this really just came out a few days ago here in germany, right before christmas. it says on imdb that the languages are ukrainian, english and spanish and english is indeed the one that is used in here most frequently. spanish also happens here and there, but it is stuff that everybody will understand or just really short inclusions, like the protagonist is called ""gato"" or ""gatito"", which means ""cat"" or ""little cat"" of course. the most memorable mention and also a slightly longer play on words was the famous and friendly ""mi casa es tu casa"" and as a response the not so famous and not so friendly, but witty ""tu casa es mi casa"". it also says there is ukrainian in here, but it must have been only a sentence or two if this is true. i don't remember. not sure why though if it is just a politically correct thing nowadays as some kind of statement. these films should not be about politics, not even in a hidden manner, but it's okay now and let's look at the basics. the directors crawford and mercado are not new to the industry by any means, but in terms of directing still relatively new. for the former, it is his second full feature film after a croods movie and for the latter it is even his first full feature film altogether. nothing unusual though. you see it also with pixar for example that directors of new movies are people who have deemed themselves worthy on television or short films before that. same with dreamworks here. the intro also included some of dreamworks' animated heroes from the last years, decades even.as for the writers, there is definitely an interesting inclusion: tommy swerdlow was an actor on ""howard the duck"", ""spaceballs"" and ""child's play"" and a writer for ""cool runnings"" in the 90s, but his move to writing animation is not completely new. he also worked on the screenplay for the new grinch movie not too long ago, so it is only fitting he is also a key writer with this one here that came out right before the holidays, even if it is not christmas-themed. another writer is tom wheeler and he has more of a history with animation, was also already a factor on the first ""puss in boots"" film over a decade ago. and paul fisher, like wheeler, worked on a lego movie and also on the aforementioned croods movie and also on a ""puss in boots"" television series that came out after the film back then, so there are definite connections within this writing trio here. no surprise their effort here turned out nicely overall. the film runs for 100 minutes approximately and that includes the closing credits already, so it is not a particularly long or short film, somewhere in the middle. i watched the german dub because the original was only shown without subtitles and i don't like that too much. still not that much to say about the german dub, a few familiar names, but the biggest was maybe oliver kalkofe voicing the character that came closest to being the villain in here. the original has of course oscar nominees antonio banderas and salma hayek. florence pugh, olivia colman and ray winstone can also be mentioned and they are probably the most known names. really decent cast. there are others that surely have no difficulties in finding a job in the industry these days.i already mentioned there was a ""puss in boots"" film more than ten years ago, so took quite some time for this sequel to come out, but then again that movie was also ""only"" a spin-off that includes a character from the ""shrek"" franchise. one who is deemed worthy of his own movie(s). i kinda agree after seeing this one here a few nights ago. animation is still on such a high level, even when it comes to original supporting characters getting a sequel to a spin-off. with ""original"" i mean of course that they were at first just supporting characters. of course, puss in boots is not a fully new character, there is this old tale obviously that the character is based on, but this is not a factor at all in this film here, even if the guy with the extravagant hair you see in here could have such a background and stem from this tale. anyway, i am pretty sure that in here you will find a few faces and characters that have appeared in previous dreamworks movies already. i cannot say for sure who though. said emperor fella seems likely and this is definitely also the case with kitty softpaws, but her history with the protagonist could also be misleading there. goldilocks seems familiar too and also the big fat evil guy who seems to have no conscience altogether. it was funny how he did have a conscience in this film, like literally a conscience that was a living creature, but that one had a gigantic challenge there and eventually just moves on. shrek you do not see here. one character that is really new here is the dog that disguises itself as a cat at the start, so the old lady will also take care of him. this was a bit of a retirement home for old felines you could say and this is where puss in boots ends up as well as he had lost eight of his nine lives already and prefers to be on the safe side. or is rather forced to be more careful. the consequence are a long beard that did not last for long though and resulted in some funny talk with kitty softpaws and also a funeral scene in which puss in boots buries his adventurous self. this scene they also kept lightly though with how he keeps showing up and talking to make sure that the character (i.e. himself) gets the speech he deserves because of how much of a hero he had always been.this grave also ends up tricking the semi-bad guys into thinking puss in boots was really dead when of course he was not. they even held him in their hands and did not know. i am talking about goldilocks here of course and her three bears. those seemed like villains early on too, especially when one bear makes a very aggressive statement to threaten another character, the old cat lady it was i think. first i thought that the bears were really just animals, but then it is shown that they also talk like humans and even get their somewhat emotional story towards the end when they try to convince goldilocks that they are the family she has always been looking for and that she does not need to make a wish anymore to find a family. in contrast to that, there is no such twist for jack horner, the really gross, really big and disgusting bad guy. he only wants the wish to make sure he becomes the mightiest magician on the planet and surely he would not use these powers for anything good. catastrophe would ensue. of course, there is no such unhappy ending. but the happy ending is really that everybody realizes they already have what they wish for, which is perhaps not too realistic and a bit too gooey but i take it. this also includes the two cat protagonists then. puss in boots wanted his eight lives back for example. the only one who never really cared about the wish was the dog. i mean he had the wish to be allowed to stay with his new family or maybe you can even call them owners if you really see puss in boots as a bit of a human character in here, but he only wanted the wish to come true if they like him too and decide to keep him. very likable and charming character. i would watch another spin-off there that shows us what happened to the dog before this film. anyway, cats and dogs do get along well here apparently. calling the protagonist human here may be true with some of his fighting skills and talking etc. but from other perspectives, he is a full-on feline. i think almost all other characters do not understand his talking and exact words and sometimes we are reminded of that when we hear cat sounds coming from him. cuteness triumphs there for sure.then there is the element of the cute eyes. we see this on both feline protagonists in this movie. during one occasion. that was enough. it still made for a nice running gag when we realize in the end that cuteness has prevailed and the dog is able to do the same. good for him as before that he was probably not seen as the cutest animal. but kind and friendly he was from the very start. aside from that, i also liked some of the music. heitor pereira did a great job with the soundtrack here. ""fearless hero"" is such a catchy tune and i liked the german version i heard as well, maybe even more than the original. both will go on my mp3 player for sure. again no big surprise that there are people with hispanic names in charge of key components here like pereira or the aforementioned januel mercado. interesting name. i only knew ""juan manuel"" so far. i mean the cat is hispanic too. anyway, it would be really cool if pereira could get an oscar nomination for his work here too, especially the song i mentioned. i don't think it is too likely though. i think for this oscar season the film came out too late and probably not too many will remember it in late 2023 or early 2024 then. but we will see, would be a cool surprise. the ending then in a way seemed like it had a touch of closure, but also that new adventures may be ahead. the film's title sounds more like closure, but time-wise i am not sure if this maybe took place before some other movie from the production studio? it is not too important though. i just hope that if there will be a third puss in boots film or even another shrek movie at some point, that it will not be another decade until then. this one here i surely give a positive recommendation and i quite enjoyed the watch. good animation (should not be taken for granted, not even in 2022), nice attention to detail (like with how the maps looked different in terms of who held them), good comedy, interesting characters... all the way it should be, even if i would still say that it was not a film that totally blew me away or so. but the thumbs-up from my side here was never in doubt. this film is a good watch for young, middle-aged and old people. give it a chance!"
"1063","puss n boots","kjproulx",2023-01-18,8," a surprise for sure
","being a huge fan of shrek and shrek 2, i will always check out anything new this franchise has to offer. like many others, i was disappointed with shrek the third. shrek forever after was fine and even though i enjoyed the first puss in boots for what it was, my enthusiasm for the franchise has started to fade over the years. for this reason alone, i was very unsure about a puss in boots sequel. it's been so long since the first one and i didn't even love that film. well, colour me incredibly surprised. puss in boots: the last wish is now playing in theatres and available on-demand and i must say that i thoroughly enjoyed it.following puss in boots (antonio banderas) many years after the events of the rest of the franchise, his love of action and adventure has caught up with him. he has used eight of his nine lives and is visited by death. he is told that the next time he dies will be the end. this has him taking a second look at his life. learning that there may be a chance of restoring his lives by venturing into the dark forest, he sets out on a quest to do so. accompanied by kitty softpaws (salma hayek) and perrito (harvey guill√©n), this is both a hilarious/fun adventure and an emotional tale that really worked for me.they have updated the animation here as well and i thought it looked very unique. i don't think this style would've worked for a shrek film, but puss in boots: the last wish was impressively stylistic. as always, antonio banderas was great as the titular hero's voice and it was great to see salma hayek return as well. i'm not very familiar with harvey guill√©n's work, but his voice work for the character of perrito had me laughing quite often, so kudos to him for that. the look of this film, the sound design, the story, and every voice actor were all standouts to me. i got a kick out of this film.to wrap this up, i guess my big complaint (even though i really don't want to complain about anything in this film) would be that it's almost too frenetic at times. it has a pace that never lets up, which is great because that never hurts the story, but i would've liked a few more beats to enjoy the dramatic moments. they took the time in the screenplay to write some moving dialogue, especially for a kid's film, but it never felt explored quite enough. i would've also complained about some side characters and what was a seemingly pointless storyline, but i enjoyed how that all played out by the end too. i can't say i loved this film, but it's a great watch at least once. puss in boots: the last wish gets a recommendation from me."
"1064","puss n boots","sunsell",2022-12-28,10," it's good story and delightful to watch puss
","story is well written and progresses well. every scene taken nicely with good elements. no unnecessary absurdness even though its animated. my first time watching puss even though been seeing posters and hearing about for like past 10 years. good cast for pull and good animation bringing the character lively and captivating. must watch. watched in 2d but 3d might be good too for those wanting in 3d. its that kind of movie that is good to watch in theatres. kid friendly too. liked it much better compared to many animated series that are overly complicated. those who have pets either cats or dogs especially will connect with this more, on a separate level."

""puss in boots 2"" is far more sincere in its story telling and emotional beats. the humor never gets in the way of its more serious moments. it is the type of film where i could see kids laughing and crying when they watch.this is dreamworks at its very finest. this last wish is the stuff dreams are made of."

","puss in boots: the last wish is a shockingly good movie. the expectation for me going into this was high as i had heard so many positives form people i trust and thus was excited to view it. however i am still shocked at just how good the movie was.first lets talk about the characters if this movie. death is by far and away my favourite villain in any of the shrek related movies and probably in all of animation. for ""kids"" movie this villain was simply so much more than you would expect. he is by far the best character in this movie (including the main three). he is the glue that holds the movie together as something excellent. every-time he is on screen i am utterly transfixed on all that's happening. he is an easy 11/10 for me and one of my favorite characters in any movie ever. saving my blushes however, i really must say that i enjoyed puss so much in this movie. he was so interesting when in his own thoughts. i must say as someone personally who has trouble with daily panic, the way that his fear is shown in this movie is second to none. most (if not all) live action movies cannot get this right. so for a movie i expected to be more childish to get this sense of fear and dread in relation to puss and his fear of death is utterly marvelous. although i must say hearing the heart of puss in boots in those intense situations made me feel a scared myself. besides from his fear and panic, puss in this movie has a well made relationship with both perro and particularly kitty softpaws that i really enjoyed. both kitty and perro where great characters. i preferred kitty a lot more it has to be said but perro was special in his own little way. i will cut these characters short as i don't want to be writing for hours. however goldilocks and the three bears i didn't mind and jack was my least favourite character (which is great as he isn't all that bad either).the story of this movie i spoke about briefly before. however this story n my eyes is the best in the whole shrek universe. death was an amazing antagonist, puss's struggles where absolutely amazing and the duo of kitty and perro where really enjoyable. i think that the dilemmas that this movie presents are just great to be a spectator of.the animation of this movie was great. this animation was far better than most animated movies and or shows i have ever seen. to anyone who believes 2d animation is always better than 3d animation i implore you to watch this film. the fight sin this movie where great. the is only single fight i didn't like in the entire runtime of the movie and it was the last fight with jack horner. the reasons for this are that i believe personally that death should have been the final fight/boss of the movie and the simple fact i believed jack horner getting sucked into the bag was enough to end his character. but the fact it's my first major negative (or negative at all) is spectacular.the ending scene that revealed far far away as the destination that puss and friends are going to is a great tease. will there be another shrek movie or puss in boots film set in the lands of far far away? i must say that i hope in the later movies of this franchise death shows up as an easter egg at some point. i'm not sure if i want him to appear in full again anytime soon as there is always a fear of ruining a character. but imagine if in the next movie in this universe you hear at some point in the movie the whistle of death as a little nod to him in this movie. that would be amazing. or maybe you see his eyes in the background of a shot i n a movie. whatever the case may be, i really want some references in future.i have not even mentioned how i think the voiced actors is this movie are perfect.characters - 10/10story 9/10animation 10/10cast/voice actors - 10/10fights - 9/10this movie is one of which i highly recommend, 9/10."

telling him that papa catton is now dead and inviting him to saltburn. we get a lot of flash backs and flash aheads showing that oliver poisoned felix, and if he didn't directly kill venetia he helped move her suicide along. he weasels his way in to taking care of elsbeth...i took it as potentially he did something to poison her and get her sick before eventually completely ending her by removing her breathing tube. we further find out that oliver also initiated the flat tire on felix's bike, and further set up a situation where felix ""found"" some money he dropped so he could buy a round of shots during a bonding moment.the movie ends with oliver now the owner of saltburn dancing around naked.if it sounds like a lot to unpack, it was. i guess there is some ""moral"" to the story - whether

","saltburn is the second feature film directed by emerald fennell, her first being 2020's promising young women which i am yet to see but let's just say after watching this film i'll be looking to watch that one pretty shortly. the film stars barry keoghan as oliver quick who when we first meet him is just starting university at oxford and due to being from a seemingly impoverished liverpudlian suburb he's finding it hard to make friends (i feel his pain). that is until he helps out felix catton (jacob elordi) who's one of the more popular pupils. felix welcomes oliver into his friend group and eventually his home during which time oliver develops what can only be described as an infatuation for felix. felix is from an incredibly wealthy family who also welcome oliver into their mansion (saltburn) but that's when things start to go awry.as i mentioned before i haven't seen fennells directorial debut and so knew little about her style going into this film. the only thing i even knew about this film was what i saw in the trailer. i had the sense that it would be quite a stylish artsy film which it is however i had no idea where the story was going to go and i was very pleasantly surprised. the film is very much a slow burn but it's never boring, i found myself entranced by the performances of the entire cast throughout. keoghan in particular gives one of the best acting performances i've seen this year and i hope he gets the recognition he deserves for such a stand out performance. the film takes around 80 minutes to set the scene as it were but once it does i was on the edge of my seat almost like a murder mystery trying to predict what was going to happen next and how the film might end. the film has twists and turns throughout which i didn't expect and by the end i could never have predicted that the film would conclude in the way that it did. this film was a real hidden gem for me and is without a doubt worth a watch. it should be said however that there are some squeamish moments, whilst it's not a horror film if you're of a nervous disposition then maybe give this one a miss.a genuinely gripping drama by a director and cast who undoubtedly have massive careers ahead of them.rating: 8/10."

","saltburn (2023) amazon prime video. writer-director emerald fennell's follow-up to the provocative promising young woman begins with a bit of misdirection as its setting is tony oxford university in england. it's shot on 35mm film and adopts a classic 1:33 aspect ratio for emphasis. oliver quick (barry keoghan) is a new student just trying to fit in. the 'in' crowd orbits around felix catton (jacob elordi who played elvis in the recent priscilla) and oliver soon sets his sights on ingratiating himself with him. thing is, oliver is a commoner and felix very much part of the ruling class, but through guile and cunning, he manages to ingratiate himself with the handsome and magnetic aristocrat to the point where he's invited to stay with felix' family during break.it's at saltburn, the catton home, where fennell's more astringent streak truly takes hold. richard e. grant (sir richard) and rosamund pike (elspeth) are the idle rich parents. carey mulligan plays a hanger on. alison oliver is felix' very needy and nervous sister venetia, and archie madekwe is farleigh, another oxford student invited to stay for the summer. fennell takes this motley stew of characters and lets the outrageousness fly (fair warning: things get icky).saltburn begins as a tale of unrequited admiration (if not formal love) and then moves towards class satire, but it's never truly credible. everything is far too drawn out and the ambition extends further than the film is capable of selling. the performances are fine. keogan sells the - sad sack with intelligence - bit quite well. pike is an imperial marvel and grant is a good match. the screenplay tries so hard to dot every ""i"" and cross every ""t"" that by doing so, it makes all the improbabilities all the more apparent (something which also befell promising young woman). the satire becomes more exhausting than sharper by the end. more damning, it has very little to add to the timeworn critique of the upper class that is a british cinema staple."

","...a movie with the word ""ripley"" in the title...here we go, with another 2 hour plus overwrought melodrama with absolutely unappealing characters. this seemed to be a trend in 2022 and 2023. barry keoghan, who was so wonderfully understated (and oscar-nominated) in banshees of inisherin, plays the devious, supposedly introverted male in this one. audiences paying close attention can realize his con game within the first 10 minutes of the movie. over two hours later, when oliver quick ends up being master of his own universe, accountable to no one, we wonder why we bothered. who needs to see this in a movie when we see it in the news headlines every day.performances are good across the board (although carey mulligan is not given enough screen time). it is nice seeing richard e. grant back, as the only somewhat sane and grounded person in the movie. in the end it's another examination of an outsider entering the lives of the elite, and realizing he likes it enough to con his way into a permanent place there. but the ending is so unsatisfying that one is left with a nasty residue in their mouth."

","no matter how much you think you're prepared for this film, you will not expect how it turns out. and for the most part that's a great thing, but there are some scenes that make me think what on earth was going on in mrs. fennell's brain.i liked the fact that the satire itself went in a different direction - while the film was advertised as an 'eat-the-rich' thriller like the menu or triangle of sadness from last year, it didn't end up going in that direction. and it's right that it didn't - fennell herself is part of that said group that should be eaten, so if she was poking fun at her own class then the satire just doesn't work as effectively. instead, it veers towards american psycho in that respect - there is a specific class that isn't discussed too much (there it's the yuppy culture, here it's the middle class who takes issue with being underrepresented to increase their status and popularity). it's a class that hasn't had too much critique in films but still continues to wreck havoc in the oxbridge sphere, so i'm glad it's been given some attention.the performances were first-class, barry keoghan can do no wrong, he certainly had to go far outside of his comfort zone for this role. jacob elordi plays a character you hate to love, the sort of person who runs the cliques in oxbridge but you want the approval of. some of the lines he says to keoghan's characters are scarily real since he is so unaware of life outside the oxbridge bubble. in fact the whole first 30 minutes is an incredibly accurate depiction of the oxbridge experience, even if it is from 2006. it goes to show that representation of all classes and regions is still very weak and requires work.the main downfall of this movie are some scenes which are so bizarre and unnecessary. i understand the obscenity to portray different sides to characters, but some of them drag on for so long and it just makes me think that it would've been so uncomfortable for the actors. hopefully they got paid a lot for it. that said, i think the final scene was absolutely cracking. it reminded me a bit of midsommar in the sense that i was meant to be filled with hatred, but i empathised with the character so much that i was having fun. which makes you consider who you look up to. food for thought."

","what makes saltburn most effective in the first two-thirds are the characters, with well-rounded performances given by barry keoghan and the aristocratic family he admires, specifically alison oliver and jacob elordi. his interactions with family members show envy and desire begin to blur, and you wonder about the characters' underlying motives. the dynamic between felix (jacob elordi) and oliver (barry keoghan) is most evident of this, with queer subtext that made me anticipate where the film was going with their relationship.then, in the last act, the movie falls flat on its face. it becomes bloated and drawn-on, and the character development that drew me in amounts to nothing. in an effort to feel clever and subvert audience expectations, emerald fennell writes in a ""twist"" that undoes most of what was interesting about the film. as a result, its message is muddled and ultimately without substance. killing off nearly all of your good characters to set up a boring james bond villain-esque monologue where the main character reveals he *planned* all of this is so so lazy and ridiculous. not only does it raise many questions of logic but it solidifies that the film has nothing interesting to say, and will ultimately be remembered for a few bold scenes rather than its quality.in fennell's other film, she pulls the same frustrating move. a movie that attempts interesting social commentary has its initial quality degraded by her need to surprise audiences, rather than write an effective ending. it makes me feel like she always begins writing screenplays before considering how they'll end.saltburn is not a boring film, and it makes up for some of what it lacks with great performances, beautiful cinematography, and engaging scenes. i just can't help but feel disappointed that a film so interesting at the start becomes so shallow."

oliver, the protagonist, who fails to have even one successful date on campus, suddenly exhibits a sexually charismatic and dominant persona, capable of bringing farleigh start, an alpha carefree cool kid, into submission. the scene is well-performed thanks to its superb actors, but it contradicts the core personality of the characters. the director suddenly bestows superpowers upon their underdog character, resulting in an unearned character twist. this instance is just one example of such inconsistencies throughout the film."

","saltburn has the makings of a great film. there's so much i liked about it, and so much i appreciate, that it is slightly disappointing that it doesn't quite hit the heights it could've. but, i do commend it for being bold, different, and as twisted as it is.the good:cinematography and set design. this movie is absolutely gorgeous. i didn't think they needed the 4:3 aspect ratio, but it made every frame - for lack of a better term - look like a painting. the ornate beauty of saltburn and the warmth of oxford university were really impressive to me. the reflection of the wealth and opulence, the nostalgia, the feeling of a hot summer; chef's kiss.the performances. barry keoghan is as great as he always is. he's undoubtedly one of the best character actors in hollywood today and once again, he proves how indispensable he is. jacob elordi really surprised me here too; he exudes the charisma and confidence you'd imagine from a rich guy who's trying to relate to other people, and this is probably his best performance since euphoria season 1.the music. oh man, did this film's music hit hard. maybe this film wins for the best needle drops of 2023? it not only evokes the time period - 2006 - but each song has a distinct meaning when you look back on it in hindsight. i was bumping the unofficial and official soundtracks immediately after seeing this.the first ""scene."" okay, so the bath tub scene is pretty notorious and commendably, is one of the scenes that has the internet on fire. i think it's perfectly done, disgusting, had me yelping at the screen, and is right transition point for the rest of the film.the writing (kinda). this movie is never dull. it always keeps you on your toes and throws enough at your way to have you guessing. i really found myself invested in the story and unable to look away (even if i wanted to, at times). i also liked the subtle character work, i appreciate little hints over a film beating you over the head with the dynamics between characters, and generally speaking, i understood why people were doing what they were doing.the bad:the writing. okay, so, after that ""first scene,"" there's a second scene that's - depending on who you are - equally gross. and, you'd expect this to make the character involved with both of these scenes shift in the narrative somewhat, and while he does, it's just not enough. it's hard to see a character who would um...do that just not reveal more of himself as a desperate weirdo. yet, we're sort of still expected to believe he's fundamentally just a shy kid. it works in the context of the film while you're watching it, but doesn't make much sense after.it's why for me, the second scene everyone is talking about, while i *get it* from a thematic point of view, it doesn't make sense for the character. it's almost as if it's happening to trick the audience more than anything else.further, the ending really requires a huge suspension of disbelief. if the film didn't already paint a picture of an extremely wealthy, powerful family, maybe this would be more believable. but in setting that premise, what transpires makes very little sense when you think about it for more than a second.the ugly:i liked saltburn a lot while watching it and it's a movie i find myself thinking about, but it is undeniably flawed. a little script editing would've gone a long way, but i appreciate most of what's here."

","denis villeneuve has accomplished what was considered impossible for decades, to write and direct a faithful adaptation to the fantastic 1965 sci-fi novel by frank herbert. and i'm here to tell you, he has done it, he has actually done it.i was introduced to the world of dune in 1992 by playing the video game dune released that year. the story completely captivated me, so i decided to read the book. and to this day, it's one of the best stories i've ever read. a tale absolutely grand in scale, and filled with details, making it really hard to adapt for the big screen, even today with all the technology we have at our disposal.i saw the film made by david lynch, a few years after i read the book, and about 10 years after it was released, and i didn't enjoy it much. the 1984 film completely fails at capturing the very essence of the novel, and feels shallow and unfocused.one of the main differences with this movie and the 1984 movie, is that villeneuve has only centered on the first half of the first novel. and with over two and a half hours runtime, he is able to concentrate more on the small details, than lynch ever could. but on the flip side, this also means that this movie has no conclusion.from reading the book, i know what comes next, i know how this story ends. but a lot of people watching this movie, especially those who haven't read the book, can obviously feel like they were watching a prologue to something great, that never happens. this is a very risky move by both villeneuve and the production companies, because this can only work if part 2 is released to conclude the story. it's kind of how they did it with ""the lord of the rings"" trilogy.but, still, without a conclusion, what a massive blast of a movie this is. i've seen it in imax twice already, and the grand scale of everything, the sandworms, the space ships, the ornithopters, the buildings, the sound effects, the soundtrack, the locations. it's epic in every meaning of the word. and all of this without losing track of the deep relationships between the characters. this is a movie that manages to perfectly blend massive awesomeness with true heartfelt emotions.the actors are near perfectly cast, all carrying their roles really well, although i felt some of them didn't get enough screen time.this movie does follow the book quite closely, but some things has been changed and/or left out to fit in a movie format, i must admit that during my second imax viewing, i felt that villeneuve maybe should have adapted this as a mini series instead. but that would have dramatically changed the grand scale of everything, but on the other hand, he could've dived deeper into the lore. two and a half hours to adapt half of the first novel, is cutting it real tight. and with all the stuff you are constantly being fed throughout this movie, it can become somewhat difficult to follow and understand it all.but that being said, i had really high hopes for this film, i was one of those people hyped beyond belief. i've been waiting for this movie for about 30 years. and still, most of this movie is either as i imagined it myself, or better.what denis villeneuve has accomplished here, is actually quite astonishing, he has actually made dune. it's finally here, it's gigantic, and close to everything i asked for.the only big drawback, is as i mentioned, that this movie has no conclusion, it's two and a half hours of build-up to something great, that never happens, but it's still a huge epic packed with an awesome soundtrack, solid acting, fantastic cgi and sound effects and jaw dropping locations captured with brilliant cinematography. it's most definitively made for the big screen, absolutely no doubt about that.denis villeneuve has once again shown us he's a force to be reckoned with, a brilliant filmmaker, and one of the best of his generation, even one of the best of all time.i give this movie a 9 out of 10. we need part 2, we need it badly. this story deserves to be concluded. but if it never comes, i will just imagine the last half of the first novel with this movie as the template."

","more so than even 'lord of the rings', frank herbert's 'dune' is an extremely difficult story to translate to film. all of the novel's many, many moving parts require the kind of explanation that just isn't possible in the format. therefore you have to find a kind of cinematic shorthand the way david lynch did with his polarizing 1984 adaptation. or else you go w/a mini-series, which allows for a greater runtime ala the syfy network's 2000 attempt. here the solution was to cut the novel essentially in half. unfortunately that creates an entirely different problem. half a story simply isn't satisfying.the film itself is handsomely shot and the f/x are strong, though i dare say the design work is rather bland. the score by hans zimmer is an oppressive yet forgettable kit-bash of the ""exotic"" white noise that litters so many fantasy and sci-fi films in the 21st century. the characters are under-cooked, but the actors themselves are by and large solid.as someone who has read the novel three times i have a difficult time deciding if the uninitiated will have even an inkling of what's going on. but even if they do, i can't imagine that what we get here will ultimately be satisfying in a substantive way."
"1212","dune","kevin_robbins",2021-10-22,10," this is an all-time great science fiction movie
","dune: part one (2021) is a movie the wife and i saw in theatres at an advanced screening. the storyline tells the tale of an emperor who changes leadership in his most important and profitable planet in his kingdom. follow the new family as they move in and adjust to a ruthless landscape filled with people who don't want to help them and resources set up for them to fail. they quickly realize they may have bit off more than they can chew on several fronts. this movie is directed by denis villeneuve (blade runner 2049) and stars timoth√©e chalamet (little women), rebecca ferguson (doctor sleep), zendaya (spider-man), oscar isaac (star wars: the rise of skywalker), jason mamoa (aquaman), dave bautista (guardians of the galaxy) and josh brolin (no country for old men). the storyline for this is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece in a star wars mixed with game of thrones kind of way. the vastness and complexity is outstanding and how all the pieces fit together is remarkable. the cast is brilliantly selected and the special effects and action scenes are breathtaking. a few scenes were shot darker than i would have liked but not enough to not call this film perfection. the action scenes are well choreographed and the fierceness of the war and fight sequences were awesome. there is a level of uncertainty in every second of the film. this is a rare masterpiece in a lord of the rings/star wars kind of way that happens once every 20-30 years that is an absolutely must see. this is an all-time great science fiction movie that is an easy 10/10."
"1213","dune","zardoz-13",2021-10-29,10," villeneuve's greatest sci-fi film
","watching director denis villeneuve's groundbreaking adaptation of frank herbert's classic science fiction novel ""dune"" is like feasting on an all-you-can-eat buffet. you can gorge yourself on combatants and conspiracies galore during its spartan 156-minute runtime. unlike its ill-fated predecessor, david lynch's critically reviled ""dune"" (1984), which shoehorned herbert's gargantuan magnum opus into a procrustean 136-minute escapade, villeneuve has the good sense not to pile everything into one film. instead, this $165 million reboot delivers only half of the chronicle, while we must bide our time until the sequel. some sci-fi fans may cringe at this prospect, but warner brothers refused to bank roll the sequel before ""dune"" generated some box office traction. mind you, sitting for two-hours and thirty-six minutes requires not only purpose but also patience. meantime, villeneuve retreads several lynch scenes, but does it with greater scope and spontaneity. you cannot help but be caught up by the rollercoaster blend of white-knuckled cliffhanger heroics and byzantine political intrigue. although classified as science fiction, ""dune"" never degenerates into a juvenile ""buck rogers"" space opera. ""star wars: rogue one"" lenser greg fraser depicts these larger-than-life characters against surreal landscapes in sprawling picturesque murals. surrounding timoth√©e chalamet, who toplines as the hero, is a formidable cast consisting of oscar isaac, josh brolin, rebecca ferguson, jason momoa, javier bardem, dave bautista, and stellan skarsgard. overall, ""dune"" raises the standards for sci-fi blockbusters. nevertheless, the filmmakers don't bewilder the audience with narrative overload. clearly, villeneuve has surpassed his earlier outing ""blade runner 2049"" (2017), and one can only wish him greater success with this sequel.imagine a mash-up of ""star wars"" and ""game of thrones,"" and you'll have a clue about what ensues. specifically, ""dune"" takes place in the year 10,191. this tour de force saga of clashing empires unfolds on the bleak desert planet of arrakis. this savage, sun-scorched world is the only source in the universe for a unique mineral called spice. not only does interstellar space travel hinge on spice, but it also is a psychedelic drug that heightens awareness and lengthens life. the evil baron vladimir (stellan skarsg√•rd of ""good will hunting"") of the house of harkonnen, who amounts to a smaller version of jabba the hutt, has reaped an obscene fortune in spice from arrakis over the last 80 years. now, the padishah emperor shaddam iv removes the baron and replaces him with a rival, duke leto atreides (oscar isaac of ""ex-machina"") of the mighty house of atreides, who hails from the ocean planet of caladan. accompanied by his consort lady jessica (rebecca ferguson of ""doctor sleep"") and their teenage son, paul (timoth√©e chalamet of ""lady bird""), the duke arrives on arrakis with his aide, gurney halleck (josh brolin of ""sicario""), and a vast army. leto suspects the corrupt emperor may be setting him up for failure.pandemonium erupts soon after leto has taken over the spice mining operation. earlier, the duke had vowed to forge an alliance with the natives. known as the fremen, this disgruntled nomadic race resides in arrakis's deep caverns and conducts campaigns like guerrilla warriors against the spice miners. suffering dreadfully under the baron, the fremen expect similar treatment from leto. the duke dispatches a scout, duncan idaho (jason momoa of ""aquaman""), to embed himself among them and win their hearts and minds. swathed in hooded white cloaks, this mahogany-skinned tribe has dazzling cobalt blue eyes from using spice. a blue-eyed babe haunts paul's dreams. meantime, the mining equipment leto inherited from the baron is in rough shape. if the broiling temps on the surface weren't bad enough, prodigious sandworms--some as long as 13-hundred feet--cruise beneath the shifting sands like great white sharks. these leviathans can wrap their elastic mouths, bristling with zillions of wicked, razor-sharp fangs, around an entire spice harvesting machine. eventually, treachery within leto's palace topples his rule, and the baron's soldiers annihilate atreides' army. miraculously managing to escape, young paul takes refuge with the fremen and ponders a rebellion against the baron.comparisons between ""dune"" and ""star wars"" are inevitable. indeed, both films share certain formulaic scenes which seem virtually interchangeable. an empire-building yarn with anti-colonial sentiments, ""dune"" takes itself far more seriously than ""star wars."" when paul watches his mentor perish, our hero suffers as tragically as luke when he witnessed the demise of obi-wan kenobi. ""dune"" differs, too, because it is a sword and sandal saga about supernatural critters. arrakis makes tatooine seem like a beach resort. villeneuve and ""prometheus"" writer jon spaihts and ""a star is born"" scripter eric roth don't overwhelm the audience with volumes of exposition that cluttered up the lynch film. instead, they parcel out exposition and use it to foreshadow events. the warfare is conducted with ancient as well as futuristic weapons, with emphasis on ancient weapons. the dragonfly helicopters-known as ornithopters-look exciting. the crisp dialogue is both pointed and compelling. villeneuve and company never cut our underdog heroes any slack in this initial bloodthirsty chapter, and the evil baron maintains the upper hand despite minor setbacks like a near-death experience. as villains go, the grotesquely fat baron makes an admirable but unscrupulous adversary. josh brolin and jason momoa wield their weapons like old hands. unlike lynch, villeneuve doesn't rub our noses in unsavory violence. nonetheless, the battles are savage without being sadistic. hans zimmer's brawling orchestral score with native choral interludes enhances the atmosphere. altogether, ""dune"" qualifies as the first truly great science fiction classic of the 21st century with a coming-of-age hero driven by prophetic dreams he cannot fathom."

","i just returned from a screening, and wow! it's visually stunning, the soundtrack by hans zimmer is majestic, the acting is spot on! the pacing might seem a little slow by todays standards, but it never gets boring. and i actually find it really refreshing to see serious scifi for adults, without bangs or a ""comic relief"" every other second.i've read the book about four or five times more than 20 years ago. and from my memory (i will refresh it soon) the movie stays true to the story of the book and, more importantly, its general feeling.opposed to many other people, i also quite liked david lynchs interpretation, despite all of its shortcomings. because one thing that lynch got right, was the ""psychedelic"" nature of the book.and that's my only gripe with denis villeneuves adaptation, and the reason why i don't give it 10 stars: while he hints at the mindaltering properties of spice, he never explores the psychedelic aspects of the book as deep as i'd like them to be explored.here's my hope for part two. if he creates a second part, and manages to keep up the quality while at the same time not shying away from the psychedelic underpinnings of the source material. he will have created a two part masterpiece."

"1216","dune","joeb131",2021-10-23,4," dune- as endless as a desert.
","there is probably no point in warning about spoilers for this film. you've probably read the book or seen either the 1984 dino delaurentis version or the 2000 sci-fi mini-series.... if you've seen either one of those, you've seen this movie. this movie only covers half the story, the sequel we'll probably never get to see will cover the other half.so how does it stack up? not well, in my opinion. it's a loud, dull action movie, with an ear-splitting soundtrack. it has all the scenes you might have seen if you watched either of those two versions, but didn't do them nearly as well.at two and a half hours, it drags on. the lynch version of the film was 137 minutes, and got the whole story in. this film leaves key aspects out, and only tells half the story, and it just goes on and on and on.to start, let's talk about characters. delaurentis got a cast of largely unknowns back then, many of whom went on to distinguish themselves. kyle maclachlin, patrick stewart, dean stockwell, sean young. heck, even the little girl actress, alicia witt, went on to have a career as an adult. this movie uses a cast of people you've heard of, and their screen time is often based on ""i know who that is."" other characters, more critical ones, were kind of shuffled to the side.i'll give two examples. a key point in the book is that the betrayal by dr. yeuh, (played here with no charisma by cheng chen) because as a suk physician, taking a human life is against his conditioning. no build up, no nothing, he just does it.on the other hand, because duncan idaho is played by jason momoa, he gets a lot more screen time than his presence in the book. (duncan's clones become a much more important part of later books, but that's neither here nor there.) his final fight scene goes on interminably here, while they were quickly brushed over in the previous versions.similarly, while peter devries is a key player in the book, here they don't even mention him by name, and he's just ""henchman who gets poisoned"". other characters are omitted altogether, including emperor shaddam, princess irulan and feyd ruatha. concepts such as the mentats, guild, bene geserit, are kind of glossed over to get to those sweet, sweet action sequences.the movie rises and falls on the actor who plays paul atreides... and again, he's actually closer to the age that the character is supposed to be at the beginning of the book, but he comes off as a little emo.again, trippy as it was, the 1984 version did this better. the sci-fi channel did it better...
now, this film really looks good. the visuals are immersive. but without strong characters and story to back them up, what's the point? it's almost like watching a transformers movie. the thing is, they had strong characters and a story... they just didn't use them."

1. it all looks absolutely gorgeous and amazingly well designed - ""firefly"" fighters are incredible, harvesters and their delivery is awesome, and many other things are equally stunning. and oh, the costumes! the costumes are the best.2. major actors playing secondary characters don't get much time at all - they're all playing their roles very well, but we barely see them at all (save perhaps jason momoa, but even his screen time is scarce).overall it's a great cinematographic feat, and the best dune adaptation so far - but we'll have to wait the rest of it to see if it holds true. i only wish they'd put more world-building details into the narrative..."

","perhaps the greatest lesson that can be drawn from denis villeneuve's dune is that ultimately an entirely satisfying adaptation of the novel is impossible. nonetheless, villeneuve's version is the closest at succeeding so far, and is one of the more enjoyable theatrical experiences of 2021.villeneuve stays very adherent to the original work, even in the smaller elements. there are a few omissions however, and the first scenes are not present in the novel.his version has however not rendered from the sense of mistery that permeates the beginning of the novel. it immediately submerges its reader in the world of dune, without any introduction, and the complex situation is slowly unraveled throughout the narrative. villeneuve's previous films prove that this approach could have been undertaken by him, but the 2021 film chose instead to rely on several expository scenes that explain too much to the audience. some of the revelations that are hinted at very early were not as clear until the second half of the novel (yet to be adapted). a choice dictated by the destination to a wider target audience, for sure, but that ultimately adds dryness to the film.another slight disappointment might come from the score by hans zimmer. it does render the majestic epic scale of the film, but it perhaps remains overly somber and ambiental in scenes where it could have charged up the depicted tense situation.what works best in dune is the flawless casting. whoever has read the novel could hardly imagine different actors to portray the characters. dune also succeeds in rendering the alien scape of the desertic planet arrakis, as well as the other planets that are even only hinted in the novel, without reduntantly using the strong saturated colours of lynch's version. greig fraser's cinematography is truly a feast for the eyes, aided by a desaturated yet captivating coloring. rest assured: the sky is never blue, which is something that the latest promotional poster seemed to suggest. on the other hand, what the film does borrow from the never made jodorowsky version is some of the production design elements, especially for the harkonnens.ultimately, even if villeneuve did not make the perfect dune film (and it is fairly possible to say at this point that such a film cannot exist), it is an entertaining film. it is entertaining and
keeps the viewer glued to the screen even despite its slow nature, leaves the viewer wanting for more, and that alone makes up for all the small imperfections it features.(extracts from my longer review on my blog, comeandreview)"

","in an age when movie and tv franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (i'm looking at you, disney), i don't think anyone was expecting much from puss in boots: the last wish - certainly not i.after the first 5 minutes, i knew this was something special.firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from arkane and enter the spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. the 2d elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.the music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).the dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling i think i've ever seen. in a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. the cast do a great job of selling them too. goldi and the bears come out with brilliant british-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.and then there's the wolf. this character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. his style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, i'm serious).at a time when disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - dreamworks have taken on the mantle.it made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. you might think i'm overselling it, but hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.there are those that say that hollywood is done - i know i do. but dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

","you heard me! my wife and i just got back from the theater, and absolutely loved this movie, even more than any of the shrek movies and the first puss in boots!this movie has so much to love, from beautiful visuals/action to consistent humor that actually had us laughing to engaging characters, both old and new. such a fun time, and so worth seeing in the theaters, though we'll definitely be picking up a copy once it's out on dvd!without giving too much away, there are several different antagonists in this movie that scratch all the bad-guy itches, covering the spectrum from totally hateable to horrifying to relatable and sympathetic. a great cast! also, the magical world they came up with for this movie was awesome, with some really cool/unique features!at first, we were a little worried about the dog character, neither of us being big fans of daffy sidekicks, but we were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves rooting for him! he's hilarious, and that's coming from a cat-lover!several callbacks to the first puss in boots movie made this one feel less like a spin-off than a worthy standalone franchise, and the movie was packed with magical references that all ages will be able to recognize and enjoy.do yourself a favor and free a few hours for this one!! a rare 10 from me!!"

","likes:pacing
-very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.adorable characters/feel
-new characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-the feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-has that element of shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.the animation
-it's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy dreamworks does so well.-the design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-the world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that i certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-and it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than disney for the blend of real and cartoons.the voice acting:
-many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that snl like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. he own the horner character and brought some of the best lines.-wagner moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the big-bad wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-pugh is okay, not my favorite role as goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. it does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-banderas takes boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the spanish stereotype. and yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.the references/jokes
-the stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of shrek.-it's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-the fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-it feels like the first two shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. again, refreshing that they were able to step back.the designs changes to an extent
-creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-like into the spiderverse? good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that puss does.-not overused, which is very good for me.the action at times
-shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-this movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-the ending fight shows the potential of what dreamworks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes i've seen this year.the heart
-lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-the movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-there are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. that's hard to do in many things.-i love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-have not felt this way since shrek 2.dislikes:the darkness
-it's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.predictable
-the lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-the movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.too many antagonists
-one of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-they do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.the comedy is still tapered
-it's starting to go back to shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made shrek, shrek.-they took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.the animation changes at times
-the animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-the comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.the action still not complete
--shrek and shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-this movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-the stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-they sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-often was shorter than i wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.the verdict
i must say, puss in boots: the last wish was a much better film than when i walked in. perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. it evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. and it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. this film is indeed a solid return to the world and i had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. however, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance i was looking for. the movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with puss in boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. and the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the shrek that we saw in the first two movies. still, i do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

"1238","dune","wolfinflannel",2023-10-21,10," restored my faith in animated movies!
","puss and boots: the last wish was a true 'feel good' movie. the plot was well thought out and transitioned flawlessly from the last puss and boots film. what made this different from the previous movie is the mature theme and sentiments that made the film enjoyable and illuminating for all ages. the story progression was smooth and did not make the movie feel too short or too long. the story's theme (life is too short, so we must value what we have) flows through several different angles and characters throughout the story. the theme is not lost during the movie and is carried by the protagonist's emotions and personal growth. the characters in this movie helped express the theme and made the film more enjoyable. puss was the perfect protagonist, and his personal growth in the movie showed the audience that it is never too late for a fresh start, especially given that his character did not transition from the last film to the beginning of this one. kitty and pedrito's contrasting personalities and feelings allow two perspectives to get through to puss and show him what it means to be a family. goldy and the three bears added an extra obstacle for 'team friendship' but highlighted the theme through their growth. death was a great character because he was simply doing his job and was the character that indirectly pushed puss to become a better person and respected him for it. jack horner was an excellent antagonist because he was indeed a villain. instead of a character that was hurt by society or had good intentions deep down, this character was a pure monster. it was refreshing to have a villain that everyone could get behind disliking. the dialogue in this movie was powerful. each sentence helped tell the story, and it did not feel like there were any filler lines. the comic relief was natural, and the emotional conversations were deep. the imagery and background in the film were well articulated and detailed. each setting aligned with the active story and flowed with the transitions. the background music of the story was also fitting; it added an extra layer for the viewer and did not distract them from the story. this movie gave hope for the future of animated movies in america."

","i have seen good movies in the year of 2022, but puss in boots: the last wish (2022) is by far the best animated movie of 2022 and is my favorite movie from that year. also, it is the best movie in the shrek franchise.the voice cast is great; antonio banderas as puss in boots was great, salma hayek was great, and harvey guill√©n as perrito was great because they are good characters, and they are funny. florence pugh as goldilocks, olivia colman as mama bear, ray winstone as papa bear, and samson kayo as baby bear were funny, and they were also good characters.there is this wolf villain in the movie that is legit creepy, was such a cool character. he does certain things that makes him a great villain for puss in boots to go against, and he is voiced by wagner moura who has a great voice for this character.the animation is beautiful in this movie; it has amazing action scenes, pretty scenery, and imaginable locations that look great in this animation style. the movie is also creative in how it uses fairytale locations and items from those stories, which is what makes another villain character voiced by john mulaney funny to watch.the movie has a simple plot but does it in a creative way with great characters, and some little references to shrek. what i especially loved was how puss in boots starts laughing in the face of danger, but because he is on his last life, he starts getting scared and starts thinking about what he has done with his earlier lives and how spent them.i had a fun time with puss in boots: the last wish (2022); it has fantastic animation, it was funny, it has great characters, it has great emotional moments, and there are great action scenes. i highly recommend checking this movie out because you will have gun with it, and i am excited to see this movie again when i get the chance."

'the last wish' may not be among the best films i have ever seen, but it is an interesting and enjoyable watch for sure.the visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the blend of two distinct animation art styles makes for an interesting cinematic experience, the score, too, sprinkled its fair share of magic, and on top of that, the characters are more fleshed out, unlike the last time, and the inclusion of 'perrito' and 'death' brought radical changes to the narrative, their mere presence made this more exciting."

","after losing his eighth life to a bell falling on top of him, puss in boots is down to his last life. an encounter from a vicious bounty hunter with a frightening presence destroys his confidence and for the first time, he feels fear. after escaping by the skin of his teeth, he decides he is no longer worthy of the name puss in boots and begins life as an adopted cat. he learns about the dark forest where someone can make a wish on the wishing star. with this in mind, the crafty feline returns to adventure to get his lives back.a little late to review this movie, but i still caught it in theaters. i knew from the trailer that this would be a cool movie. at first, i was wondering why dreamworks is creating another puss in boots movie. it feels weird to make a sequel to a spin-off that came out over a decade ago. as someone who has not watched the original puss in boots, i do not think you need to watch the original to get what is going on here aside from maybe puss' relationship with kitty softpaws. with that said, let me tell you how good this movie is!puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animated films. first of all, the animation looks absolutely stunning. the movie has probably the best animation from a cgi film i have ever seen. not only do the movement and expressions look smooth and crisp, the cinematography and imagery looks amazing and memorable too. there are many awesome shots in this film such as a shot of puss staring in the eyes of death. these shots strengthen the emotional moments and even some of the funny moments as well. every shot in this movie looks awesome. the animation really shows its fluidity in the action scenes. this movie has better action than 90% percent of the live-action blockbusters out there. the set pieces are so dynamic and entertaining that there is not a boring moment in the film. the opening set piece sets the tone for the entire movie and from that point forward, i knew i was in for a ride. the soundtrack is awesome too from the catchy score to the fun opening song for puss in boots.fantastic visuals aside, the story is memorable too. this movie pushes its pg rating. there is blood, cursing and dark themes that may frighten younger viewers. the story is about how puss is reacting to the idea that he is on deaths door. if he dies one more time, he will be gone forever. this is a movie where we see one of the coolest and most confident characters in animation lose his confidence. with that, he has a character arc that gives him depths and flaws that are relatable so even when he does something kind of selfish, you can still sympathize with his motivations. this movie has a lot of stylish action and funny jokes, but the scenes revolving around the wolf ramp up the dark tone of the movie. it never loses its sense of humor and this is one funny movie. i love the snarky dialogue, perrito gets one scene with goldilocks and the three bears that steals the show comedy wise. this movie has the perfect mix of comedy, action, drama and emotional moments to make it stand out.in addition to a great story, the cast of characters are memorable too. puss is at his best. he is the same awesome and adorable character from shrek, but he is given a lot of vulnerability here. he starts out as this arrogant, but powerful guy who can take down giants, but when he sees that death is coming for him, you can see how it shakes him to the core. his friends kitty softpaws and especially perrito are great characters too. perrito seems like the guy that would annoy everyone, but he is a great support character who is hilarious and just plain adorable. he is also surprisingly aware of emotions. there is one scene with him and puss that warmed my heart.as for the antagonists, the wolf is one of my favorite antagonists in an animated film. he has a badass voice, he completely changes the tone of the movie and he wipes out puss' bravado entirely and reduces him to a frightened cat. he is also a great fighter, but it is his presence, voice, dialogue and whistle that make him truly memorable. kids might have nightmares because of him. goldilocks and the three bears are fun anti-villains that have a sweet bond with each other. then there is the gluttonous scumbag jack horner. this is the character the writers decided to just make as hilariously hatable and disgusting as possible. they make no attempt to give this guy any sympathetic trait and i love it. we need more outright terrible people in new animated films. he is a funny villain with how unapologetic he is towards his minions, but you will be actively rooting for this character's demise.every single character in this film is memorable to a degree. it helps that the voice acting in this movie is excellent with antonio banderas as puss, salma hayek as kitty, harvey gull√©n as perrito, john mulaney as jack horner and especially wagner moura as the wolf. moura might have one of the best voices for a villain in animation i have seen in a while. each person brings their character to life in this movie. i can see any main character here being someone's favorite in the movie. that is how you know that you have a great cast.there is not a dull moment in this movie. puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animation and more. i did not expect a movie like this to be that great, but when i saw the trailers with the gorgeous animation, i knew this movie was going to be a ride. i did not expect it to become one of my favorite films of 2022, but it definitely. i really hope it wins best animated feature at the academy awards this year. dreamworks deserves this one. check it out as soon as you can."

","alright i know what you're thinking after seeing the score of this review. ""sequels to spin-offs of beloved franchises are pointless exercises in brand awareness! why on earth are you giving this one a 10?!?""because this movie...is different than the others. different in that it strives to be a funnier, deeper, prettier, bolder, edgier, (surprisingly) scarier and overall more complete experience than the original puss in boots film over 11 years ago, and unlike that movie holds a distinct accomplishment in simply being a darn fine animated film that stands on its own, one as good as any i've seen in the past few years.the shrekiverse is officially back, and judging by what dreamworks managed to pull off here the world probably isn't ready for whatever comes next. seriously, this gives the first two films in the franchise alone a run for their money.looks like the house that shrek built is finally back on top again.ps: that cricket with the spot-on jimmy stewart voice is one of the funniest things i've seen this year, whoever came up with him deserves a pay raise and a medal and free coffee and recognition from the united nations."

","in an age when movie and tv franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (i'm looking at you, disney), i don't think anyone was expecting much from puss in boots: the last wish - certainly not i.after the first 5 minutes, i knew this was something special.firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from arkane and enter the spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. the 2d elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.the music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).the dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling i think i've ever seen. in a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. the cast do a great job of selling them too. goldi and the bears come out with brilliant british-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.and then there's the wolf. this character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. his style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, i'm serious).at a time when disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - dreamworks have taken on the mantle.it made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. you might think i'm overselling it, but hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.there are those that say that hollywood is done - i know i do. but dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

-very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.adorable characters/feel
-new characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-the feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-has that element of shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.the animation
-it's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy dreamworks does so well.-the design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-the world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that i certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-and it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than disney for the blend of real and cartoons.the voice acting:
-many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that snl like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. he own the horner character and brought some of the best lines.-wagner moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the big-bad wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-pugh is okay, not my favorite role as goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. it does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-banderas takes boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the spanish stereotype. and yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.the references/jokes
-the stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of shrek.-it's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-the fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-it feels like the first two shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. again, refreshing that they were able to step back.the designs changes to an extent
-creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-like into the spiderverse? good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that puss does.-not overused, which is very good for me.the action at times
-shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-this movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-the ending fight shows the potential of what dreamworks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes i've seen this year.the heart
-lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-the movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-there are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. that's hard to do in many things.-i love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-have not felt this way since shrek 2.dislikes:the darkness
-it's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.predictable
-the lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-the movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.too many antagonists
-one of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-they do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.the comedy is still tapered
-it's starting to go back to shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made shrek, shrek.-they took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.the animation changes at times
-the animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-the comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.the action still not complete
--shrek and shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-this movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-the stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-they sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-often was shorter than i wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.the verdict
i must say, puss in boots: the last wish was a much better film than when i walked in. perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. it evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. and it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. this film is indeed a solid return to the world and i had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. however, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance i was looking for. the movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with puss in boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. and the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the shrek that we saw in the first two movies. still, i do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

","puss and boots: the last wish was a true 'feel good' movie. the plot was well thought out and transitioned flawlessly from the last puss and boots film. what made this different from the previous movie is the mature theme and sentiments that made the film enjoyable and illuminating for all ages. the story progression was smooth and did not make the movie feel too short or too long. the story's theme (life is too short, so we must value what we have) flows through several different angles and characters throughout the story. the theme is not lost during the movie and is carried by the protagonist's emotions and personal growth. the characters in this movie helped express the theme and made the film more enjoyable. puss was the perfect protagonist, and his personal growth in the movie showed the audience that it is never too late for a fresh start, especially given that his character did not transition from the last film to the beginning of this one. kitty and pedrito's contrasting personalities and feelings allow two perspectives to get through to puss and show him what it means to be a family. goldy and the three bears added an extra obstacle for 'team friendship' but highlighted the theme through their growth. death was a great character because he was simply doing his job and was the character that indirectly pushed puss to become a better person and respected him for it. jack horner was an excellent antagonist because he was indeed a villain. instead of a character that was hurt by society or had good intentions deep down, this character was a pure monster. it was refreshing to have a villain that everyone could get behind disliking. the dialogue in this movie was powerful. each sentence helped tell the story, and it did not feel like there were any filler lines. the comic relief was natural, and the emotional conversations were deep. the imagery and background in the film were well articulated and detailed. each setting aligned with the active story and flowed with the transitions. the background music of the story was also fitting; it added an extra layer for the viewer and did not distract them from the story. this movie gave hope for the future of animated movies in america."

'the last wish' may not be among the best films i have ever seen, but it is an interesting and enjoyable watch for sure.the visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the blend of two distinct animation art styles makes for an interesting cinematic experience, the score, too, sprinkled its fair share of magic, and on top of that, the characters are more fleshed out, unlike the last time, and the inclusion of 'perrito' and 'death' brought radical changes to the narrative, their mere presence made this more exciting."

","after losing his eighth life to a bell falling on top of him, puss in boots is down to his last life. an encounter from a vicious bounty hunter with a frightening presence destroys his confidence and for the first time, he feels fear. after escaping by the skin of his teeth, he decides he is no longer worthy of the name puss in boots and begins life as an adopted cat. he learns about the dark forest where someone can make a wish on the wishing star. with this in mind, the crafty feline returns to adventure to get his lives back.a little late to review this movie, but i still caught it in theaters. i knew from the trailer that this would be a cool movie. at first, i was wondering why dreamworks is creating another puss in boots movie. it feels weird to make a sequel to a spin-off that came out over a decade ago. as someone who has not watched the original puss in boots, i do not think you need to watch the original to get what is going on here aside from maybe puss' relationship with kitty softpaws. with that said, let me tell you how good this movie is!puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animated films. first of all, the animation looks absolutely stunning. the movie has probably the best animation from a cgi film i have ever seen. not only do the movement and expressions look smooth and crisp, the cinematography and imagery looks amazing and memorable too. there are many awesome shots in this film such as a shot of puss staring in the eyes of death. these shots strengthen the emotional moments and even some of the funny moments as well. every shot in this movie looks awesome. the animation really shows its fluidity in the action scenes. this movie has better action than 90% percent of the live-action blockbusters out there. the set pieces are so dynamic and entertaining that there is not a boring moment in the film. the opening set piece sets the tone for the entire movie and from that point forward, i knew i was in for a ride. the soundtrack is awesome too from the catchy score to the fun opening song for puss in boots.fantastic visuals aside, the story is memorable too. this movie pushes its pg rating. there is blood, cursing and dark themes that may frighten younger viewers. the story is about how puss is reacting to the idea that he is on deaths door. if he dies one more time, he will be gone forever. this is a movie where we see one of the coolest and most confident characters in animation lose his confidence. with that, he has a character arc that gives him depths and flaws that are relatable so even when he does something kind of selfish, you can still sympathize with his motivations. this movie has a lot of stylish action and funny jokes, but the scenes revolving around the wolf ramp up the dark tone of the movie. it never loses its sense of humor and this is one funny movie. i love the snarky dialogue, perrito gets one scene with goldilocks and the three bears that steals the show comedy wise. this movie has the perfect mix of comedy, action, drama and emotional moments to make it stand out.in addition to a great story, the cast of characters are memorable too. puss is at his best. he is the same awesome and adorable character from shrek, but he is given a lot of vulnerability here. he starts out as this arrogant, but powerful guy who can take down giants, but when he sees that death is coming for him, you can see how it shakes him to the core. his friends kitty softpaws and especially perrito are great characters too. perrito seems like the guy that would annoy everyone, but he is a great support character who is hilarious and just plain adorable. he is also surprisingly aware of emotions. there is one scene with him and puss that warmed my heart.as for the antagonists, the wolf is one of my favorite antagonists in an animated film. he has a badass voice, he completely changes the tone of the movie and he wipes out puss' bravado entirely and reduces him to a frightened cat. he is also a great fighter, but it is his presence, voice, dialogue and whistle that make him truly memorable. kids might have nightmares because of him. goldilocks and the three bears are fun anti-villains that have a sweet bond with each other. then there is the gluttonous scumbag jack horner. this is the character the writers decided to just make as hilariously hatable and disgusting as possible. they make no attempt to give this guy any sympathetic trait and i love it. we need more outright terrible people in new animated films. he is a funny villain with how unapologetic he is towards his minions, but you will be actively rooting for this character's demise.every single character in this film is memorable to a degree. it helps that the voice acting in this movie is excellent with antonio banderas as puss, salma hayek as kitty, harvey gull√©n as perrito, john mulaney as jack horner and especially wagner moura as the wolf. moura might have one of the best voices for a villain in animation i have seen in a while. each person brings their character to life in this movie. i can see any main character here being someone's favorite in the movie. that is how you know that you have a great cast.there is not a dull moment in this movie. puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animation and more. i did not expect a movie like this to be that great, but when i saw the trailers with the gorgeous animation, i knew this movie was going to be a ride. i did not expect it to become one of my favorite films of 2022, but it definitely. i really hope it wins best animated feature at the academy awards this year. dreamworks deserves this one. check it out as soon as you can."

"1282","dune","huwbutts",2023-02-16,10," puts most recent movies, not just animated movies, to shame.
","in an age when movie and tv franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (i'm looking at you, disney), i don't think anyone was expecting much from puss in boots: the last wish - certainly not i.after the first 5 minutes, i knew this was something special.firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from arkane and enter the spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. the 2d elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.the music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).the dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling i think i've ever seen. in a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. the cast do a great job of selling them too. goldi and the bears come out with brilliant british-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.and then there's the wolf. this character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. his style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, i'm serious).at a time when disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - dreamworks have taken on the mantle.it made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. you might think i'm overselling it, but hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.there are those that say that hollywood is done - i know i do. but dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

-very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.adorable characters/feel
-new characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-the feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-has that element of shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.the animation
-it's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy dreamworks does so well.-the design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-the world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that i certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-and it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than disney for the blend of real and cartoons.the voice acting:
-many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that snl like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. he own the horner character and brought some of the best lines.-wagner moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the big-bad wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-pugh is okay, not my favorite role as goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. it does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-banderas takes boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the spanish stereotype. and yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.the references/jokes
-the stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of shrek.-it's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-the fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-it feels like the first two shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. again, refreshing that they were able to step back.the designs changes to an extent
-creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-like into the spiderverse? good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that puss does.-not overused, which is very good for me.the action at times
-shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-this movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-the ending fight shows the potential of what dreamworks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes i've seen this year.the heart
-lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-the movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-there are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. that's hard to do in many things.-i love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-have not felt this way since shrek 2.dislikes:the darkness
-it's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.predictable
-the lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-the movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.too many antagonists
-one of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-they do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.the comedy is still tapered
-it's starting to go back to shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made shrek, shrek.-they took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.the animation changes at times
-the animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-the comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.the action still not complete
--shrek and shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-this movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-the stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-they sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-often was shorter than i wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.the verdict
i must say, puss in boots: the last wish was a much better film than when i walked in. perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. it evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. and it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. this film is indeed a solid return to the world and i had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. however, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance i was looking for. the movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with puss in boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. and the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the shrek that we saw in the first two movies. still, i do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

","puss and boots: the last wish was a true 'feel good' movie. the plot was well thought out and transitioned flawlessly from the last puss and boots film. what made this different from the previous movie is the mature theme and sentiments that made the film enjoyable and illuminating for all ages. the story progression was smooth and did not make the movie feel too short or too long. the story's theme (life is too short, so we must value what we have) flows through several different angles and characters throughout the story. the theme is not lost during the movie and is carried by the protagonist's emotions and personal growth. the characters in this movie helped express the theme and made the film more enjoyable. puss was the perfect protagonist, and his personal growth in the movie showed the audience that it is never too late for a fresh start, especially given that his character did not transition from the last film to the beginning of this one. kitty and pedrito's contrasting personalities and feelings allow two perspectives to get through to puss and show him what it means to be a family. goldy and the three bears added an extra obstacle for 'team friendship' but highlighted the theme through their growth. death was a great character because he was simply doing his job and was the character that indirectly pushed puss to become a better person and respected him for it. jack horner was an excellent antagonist because he was indeed a villain. instead of a character that was hurt by society or had good intentions deep down, this character was a pure monster. it was refreshing to have a villain that everyone could get behind disliking. the dialogue in this movie was powerful. each sentence helped tell the story, and it did not feel like there were any filler lines. the comic relief was natural, and the emotional conversations were deep. the imagery and background in the film were well articulated and detailed. each setting aligned with the active story and flowed with the transitions. the background music of the story was also fitting; it added an extra layer for the viewer and did not distract them from the story. this movie gave hope for the future of animated movies in america."

","this is the best animated feature since into the spider-verse, and probably better than toy story 4 and soul. i don't find many movies rewatchable nowadays and this is one of the few. not only is it a visual masterpiece (huge credit to the animators, well done!) but from a critical standpoint is has extremely well done characters, an engaging and relatable story, and takes very bold actions that will leave animation-lovers stunned for years to come. spoilers would be ruining an experience that you simply must witness for yourself, so what are you waiting for? believe the hype, go watch it if you haven't already! 9.5/10 but imma round up.edit: i've given it a year and came back to it and it's just even better the second viewing. in my opinion this is dreamwork's greatest movie (especially if you take away the first 5 minutes), better than kung fu panda, how to train your dragon, even prince of egypt. also the only dreamworks movie that i think deserves a 10/10. it's one thing to make an actually good and compelling story but to be also very entertaining and engaging for everyone is another feat. the user ratings and critics ratings are way too low. most criticisms of the movie are, imo, flawed, non-existent or biased. i sincerely cannot recommend this movie enough."
"1294","dune","soumikbanerjee1996",2023-01-12,8," one darn good entertainer!
","this has caused quite a stir in recent days, and it's it safe to say that it eventually caught my interest. speaking for myself, i knew nothing about puss because i had never seen a single movie in the 'shrek' lineup, which sparked my curiosity even more.to prep for this allegedly wonderful sequel, i had to finish the first film first, which i did. i saw the first puss in boots movie this morning, but to my utter disappointment, it did not meet my expectations, and uncertainty worked its way in. i was worried about whether the sequel would live up to the hype.and i am pleased to report that it did. 'the last wish' may not be among the best films i have ever seen, but it is an interesting and enjoyable watch for sure.the visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the blend of two distinct animation art styles makes for an interesting cinematic experience, the score, too, sprinkled its fair share of magic, and on top of that, the characters are more fleshed out, unlike the last time, and the inclusion of 'perrito' and 'death' brought radical changes to the narrative, their mere presence made this more exciting."

","after losing his eighth life to a bell falling on top of him, puss in boots is down to his last life. an encounter from a vicious bounty hunter with a frightening presence destroys his confidence and for the first time, he feels fear. after escaping by the skin of his teeth, he decides he is no longer worthy of the name puss in boots and begins life as an adopted cat. he learns about the dark forest where someone can make a wish on the wishing star. with this in mind, the crafty feline returns to adventure to get his lives back.a little late to review this movie, but i still caught it in theaters. i knew from the trailer that this would be a cool movie. at first, i was wondering why dreamworks is creating another puss in boots movie. it feels weird to make a sequel to a spin-off that came out over a decade ago. as someone who has not watched the original puss in boots, i do not think you need to watch the original to get what is going on here aside from maybe puss' relationship with kitty softpaws. with that said, let me tell you how good this movie is!puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animated films. first of all, the animation looks absolutely stunning. the movie has probably the best animation from a cgi film i have ever seen. not only do the movement and expressions look smooth and crisp, the cinematography and imagery looks amazing and memorable too. there are many awesome shots in this film such as a shot of puss staring in the eyes of death. these shots strengthen the emotional moments and even some of the funny moments as well. every shot in this movie looks awesome. the animation really shows its fluidity in the action scenes. this movie has better action than 90% percent of the live-action blockbusters out there. the set pieces are so dynamic and entertaining that there is not a boring moment in the film. the opening set piece sets the tone for the entire movie and from that point forward, i knew i was in for a ride. the soundtrack is awesome too from the catchy score to the fun opening song for puss in boots.fantastic visuals aside, the story is memorable too. this movie pushes its pg rating. there is blood, cursing and dark themes that may frighten younger viewers. the story is about how puss is reacting to the idea that he is on deaths door. if he dies one more time, he will be gone forever. this is a movie where we see one of the coolest and most confident characters in animation lose his confidence. with that, he has a character arc that gives him depths and flaws that are relatable so even when he does something kind of selfish, you can still sympathize with his motivations. this movie has a lot of stylish action and funny jokes, but the scenes revolving around the wolf ramp up the dark tone of the movie. it never loses its sense of humor and this is one funny movie. i love the snarky dialogue, perrito gets one scene with goldilocks and the three bears that steals the show comedy wise. this movie has the perfect mix of comedy, action, drama and emotional moments to make it stand out.in addition to a great story, the cast of characters are memorable too. puss is at his best. he is the same awesome and adorable character from shrek, but he is given a lot of vulnerability here. he starts out as this arrogant, but powerful guy who can take down giants, but when he sees that death is coming for him, you can see how it shakes him to the core. his friends kitty softpaws and especially perrito are great characters too. perrito seems like the guy that would annoy everyone, but he is a great support character who is hilarious and just plain adorable. he is also surprisingly aware of emotions. there is one scene with him and puss that warmed my heart.as for the antagonists, the wolf is one of my favorite antagonists in an animated film. he has a badass voice, he completely changes the tone of the movie and he wipes out puss' bravado entirely and reduces him to a frightened cat. he is also a great fighter, but it is his presence, voice, dialogue and whistle that make him truly memorable. kids might have nightmares because of him. goldilocks and the three bears are fun anti-villains that have a sweet bond with each other. then there is the gluttonous scumbag jack horner. this is the character the writers decided to just make as hilariously hatable and disgusting as possible. they make no attempt to give this guy any sympathetic trait and i love it. we need more outright terrible people in new animated films. he is a funny villain with how unapologetic he is towards his minions, but you will be actively rooting for this character's demise.every single character in this film is memorable to a degree. it helps that the voice acting in this movie is excellent with antonio banderas as puss, salma hayek as kitty, harvey gull√©n as perrito, john mulaney as jack horner and especially wagner moura as the wolf. moura might have one of the best voices for a villain in animation i have seen in a while. each person brings their character to life in this movie. i can see any main character here being someone's favorite in the movie. that is how you know that you have a great cast.there is not a dull moment in this movie. puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animation and more. i did not expect a movie like this to be that great, but when i saw the trailers with the gorgeous animation, i knew this movie was going to be a ride. i did not expect it to become one of my favorite films of 2022, but it definitely. i really hope it wins best animated feature at the academy awards this year. dreamworks deserves this one. check it out as soon as you can."

""sequels to spin-offs of beloved franchises are pointless exercises in brand awareness! why on earth are you giving this one a 10?!?""because this movie...is different than the others. different in that it strives to be a funnier, deeper, prettier, bolder, edgier, (surprisingly) scarier and overall more complete experience than the original puss in boots film over 11 years ago, and unlike that movie holds a distinct accomplishment in simply being a darn fine animated film that stands on its own, one as good as any i've seen in the past few years.the shrekiverse is officially back, and judging by what dreamworks managed to pull off here the world probably isn't ready for whatever comes next. seriously, this gives the first two films in the franchise alone a run for their money.looks like the house that shrek built is finally back on top again.ps: that cricket with the spot-on jimmy stewart voice is one of the funniest things i've seen this year, whoever came up with him deserves a pay raise and a medal and free coffee and recognition from the united nations."

","in an age when movie and tv franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (i'm looking at you, disney), i don't think anyone was expecting much from puss in boots: the last wish - certainly not i.after the first 5 minutes, i knew this was something special.firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from arkane and enter the spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. the 2d elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.the music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).the dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling i think i've ever seen. in a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. the cast do a great job of selling them too. goldi and the bears come out with brilliant british-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.and then there's the wolf. this character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. his style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, i'm serious).at a time when disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - dreamworks have taken on the mantle.it made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. you might think i'm overselling it, but hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.there are those that say that hollywood is done - i know i do. but dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

-very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.adorable characters/feel
-new characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-the feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-has that element of shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.the animation
-it's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy dreamworks does so well.-the design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-the world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that i certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-and it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than disney for the blend of real and cartoons.the voice acting:
-many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that snl like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. he own the horner character and brought some of the best lines.-wagner moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the big-bad wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-pugh is okay, not my favorite role as goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. it does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-banderas takes boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the spanish stereotype. and yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.the references/jokes
-the stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of shrek.-it's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-the fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-it feels like the first two shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. again, refreshing that they were able to step back.the designs changes to an extent
-creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-like into the spiderverse? good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that puss does.-not overused, which is very good for me.the action at times
-shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-this movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-the ending fight shows the potential of what dreamworks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes i've seen this year.the heart
-lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-the movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-there are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. that's hard to do in many things.-i love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-have not felt this way since shrek 2.dislikes:the darkness
-it's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.predictable
-the lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-the movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.too many antagonists
-one of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-they do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.the comedy is still tapered
-it's starting to go back to shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made shrek, shrek.-they took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.the animation changes at times
-the animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-the comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.the action still not complete
--shrek and shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-this movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-the stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-they sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-often was shorter than i wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.the verdict
i must say, puss in boots: the last wish was a much better film than when i walked in. perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. it evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. and it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. this film is indeed a solid return to the world and i had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. however, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance i was looking for. the movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with puss in boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. and the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the shrek that we saw in the first two movies. still, i do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

","puss and boots: the last wish was a true 'feel good' movie. the plot was well thought out and transitioned flawlessly from the last puss and boots film. what made this different from the previous movie is the mature theme and sentiments that made the film enjoyable and illuminating for all ages. the story progression was smooth and did not make the movie feel too short or too long. the story's theme (life is too short, so we must value what we have) flows through several different angles and characters throughout the story. the theme is not lost during the movie and is carried by the protagonist's emotions and personal growth. the characters in this movie helped express the theme and made the film more enjoyable. puss was the perfect protagonist, and his personal growth in the movie showed the audience that it is never too late for a fresh start, especially given that his character did not transition from the last film to the beginning of this one. kitty and pedrito's contrasting personalities and feelings allow two perspectives to get through to puss and show him what it means to be a family. goldy and the three bears added an extra obstacle for 'team friendship' but highlighted the theme through their growth. death was a great character because he was simply doing his job and was the character that indirectly pushed puss to become a better person and respected him for it. jack horner was an excellent antagonist because he was indeed a villain. instead of a character that was hurt by society or had good intentions deep down, this character was a pure monster. it was refreshing to have a villain that everyone could get behind disliking. the dialogue in this movie was powerful. each sentence helped tell the story, and it did not feel like there were any filler lines. the comic relief was natural, and the emotional conversations were deep. the imagery and background in the film were well articulated and detailed. each setting aligned with the active story and flowed with the transitions. the background music of the story was also fitting; it added an extra layer for the viewer and did not distract them from the story. this movie gave hope for the future of animated movies in america."

","this film is extremely entertaining, hilarious, but also intriguing and can be genuinely intense. it has some very dark scenes and a surprising amount of violence, which is complimented by a ton of great dark humor (mostly brought on by john mulaney's character). the characters are all very well developed and fleshed out (everyone has backstories for example), many of them get satisfying archs. on the technical side, this film is incredibly animated and every frame looks gorgeous. it has a unique style on the animation that really makes this movie its own, and it doesn't feel like a rip-off of spider verse to me at all. there's a ton of detail and symbolism to analyze with this film as well, especially in the battle scenes between puss and the wolf, which have a ton of interesting details and moves (as far as a cat vs a wolf goes).i always complain about finales in animated movies being underwhelming, but this movie had an amazing finale that is not too short or too long, has some amazing battles, character archs, and satisfying moments (also the setpiece they use is awesome)this movie is great for kids and adults. it's just that good."

","i have seen good movies in the year of 2022, but puss in boots: the last wish (2022) is by far the best animated movie of 2022 and is my favorite movie from that year. also, it is the best movie in the shrek franchise.the voice cast is great; antonio banderas as puss in boots was great, salma hayek was great, and harvey guill√©n as perrito was great because they are good characters, and they are funny. florence pugh as goldilocks, olivia colman as mama bear, ray winstone as papa bear, and samson kayo as baby bear were funny, and they were also good characters.there is this wolf villain in the movie that is legit creepy, was such a cool character. he does certain things that makes him a great villain for puss in boots to go against, and he is voiced by wagner moura who has a great voice for this character.the animation is beautiful in this movie; it has amazing action scenes, pretty scenery, and imaginable locations that look great in this animation style. the movie is also creative in how it uses fairytale locations and items from those stories, which is what makes another villain character voiced by john mulaney funny to watch.the movie has a simple plot but does it in a creative way with great characters, and some little references to shrek. what i especially loved was how puss in boots starts laughing in the face of danger, but because he is on his last life, he starts getting scared and starts thinking about what he has done with his earlier lives and how spent them.i had a fun time with puss in boots: the last wish (2022); it has fantastic animation, it was funny, it has great characters, it has great emotional moments, and there are great action scenes. i highly recommend checking this movie out because you will have gun with it, and i am excited to see this movie again when i get the chance."
"1318","dune","jakebunker",2023-07-08,10," believe the hype
","this is the best animated feature since into the spider-verse, and probably better than toy story 4 and soul. i don't find many movies rewatchable nowadays and this is one of the few. not only is it a visual masterpiece (huge credit to the animators, well done!) but from a critical standpoint is has extremely well done characters, an engaging and relatable story, and takes very bold actions that will leave animation-lovers stunned for years to come. spoilers would be ruining an experience that you simply must witness for yourself, so what are you waiting for? believe the hype, go watch it if you haven't already! 9.5/10 but imma round up.edit: i've given it a year and came back to it and it's just even better the second viewing. in my opinion this is dreamwork's greatest movie (especially if you take away the first 5 minutes), better than kung fu panda, how to train your dragon, even prince of egypt. also the only dreamworks movie that i think deserves a 10/10. it's one thing to make an actually good and compelling story but to be also very entertaining and engaging for everyone is another feat. the user ratings and critics ratings are way too low. most criticisms of the movie are, imo, flawed, non-existent or biased. i sincerely cannot recommend this movie enough."

'the last wish' may not be among the best films i have ever seen, but it is an interesting and enjoyable watch for sure.the visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the blend of two distinct animation art styles makes for an interesting cinematic experience, the score, too, sprinkled its fair share of magic, and on top of that, the characters are more fleshed out, unlike the last time, and the inclusion of 'perrito' and 'death' brought radical changes to the narrative, their mere presence made this more exciting."

","after losing his eighth life to a bell falling on top of him, puss in boots is down to his last life. an encounter from a vicious bounty hunter with a frightening presence destroys his confidence and for the first time, he feels fear. after escaping by the skin of his teeth, he decides he is no longer worthy of the name puss in boots and begins life as an adopted cat. he learns about the dark forest where someone can make a wish on the wishing star. with this in mind, the crafty feline returns to adventure to get his lives back.a little late to review this movie, but i still caught it in theaters. i knew from the trailer that this would be a cool movie. at first, i was wondering why dreamworks is creating another puss in boots movie. it feels weird to make a sequel to a spin-off that came out over a decade ago. as someone who has not watched the original puss in boots, i do not think you need to watch the original to get what is going on here aside from maybe puss' relationship with kitty softpaws. with that said, let me tell you how good this movie is!puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animated films. first of all, the animation looks absolutely stunning. the movie has probably the best animation from a cgi film i have ever seen. not only do the movement and expressions look smooth and crisp, the cinematography and imagery looks amazing and memorable too. there are many awesome shots in this film such as a shot of puss staring in the eyes of death. these shots strengthen the emotional moments and even some of the funny moments as well. every shot in this movie looks awesome. the animation really shows its fluidity in the action scenes. this movie has better action than 90% percent of the live-action blockbusters out there. the set pieces are so dynamic and entertaining that there is not a boring moment in the film. the opening set piece sets the tone for the entire movie and from that point forward, i knew i was in for a ride. the soundtrack is awesome too from the catchy score to the fun opening song for puss in boots.fantastic visuals aside, the story is memorable too. this movie pushes its pg rating. there is blood, cursing and dark themes that may frighten younger viewers. the story is about how puss is reacting to the idea that he is on deaths door. if he dies one more time, he will be gone forever. this is a movie where we see one of the coolest and most confident characters in animation lose his confidence. with that, he has a character arc that gives him depths and flaws that are relatable so even when he does something kind of selfish, you can still sympathize with his motivations. this movie has a lot of stylish action and funny jokes, but the scenes revolving around the wolf ramp up the dark tone of the movie. it never loses its sense of humor and this is one funny movie. i love the snarky dialogue, perrito gets one scene with goldilocks and the three bears that steals the show comedy wise. this movie has the perfect mix of comedy, action, drama and emotional moments to make it stand out.in addition to a great story, the cast of characters are memorable too. puss is at his best. he is the same awesome and adorable character from shrek, but he is given a lot of vulnerability here. he starts out as this arrogant, but powerful guy who can take down giants, but when he sees that death is coming for him, you can see how it shakes him to the core. his friends kitty softpaws and especially perrito are great characters too. perrito seems like the guy that would annoy everyone, but he is a great support character who is hilarious and just plain adorable. he is also surprisingly aware of emotions. there is one scene with him and puss that warmed my heart.as for the antagonists, the wolf is one of my favorite antagonists in an animated film. he has a badass voice, he completely changes the tone of the movie and he wipes out puss' bravado entirely and reduces him to a frightened cat. he is also a great fighter, but it is his presence, voice, dialogue and whistle that make him truly memorable. kids might have nightmares because of him. goldilocks and the three bears are fun anti-villains that have a sweet bond with each other. then there is the gluttonous scumbag jack horner. this is the character the writers decided to just make as hilariously hatable and disgusting as possible. they make no attempt to give this guy any sympathetic trait and i love it. we need more outright terrible people in new animated films. he is a funny villain with how unapologetic he is towards his minions, but you will be actively rooting for this character's demise.every single character in this film is memorable to a degree. it helps that the voice acting in this movie is excellent with antonio banderas as puss, salma hayek as kitty, harvey gull√©n as perrito, john mulaney as jack horner and especially wagner moura as the wolf. moura might have one of the best voices for a villain in animation i have seen in a while. each person brings their character to life in this movie. i can see any main character here being someone's favorite in the movie. that is how you know that you have a great cast.there is not a dull moment in this movie. puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animation and more. i did not expect a movie like this to be that great, but when i saw the trailers with the gorgeous animation, i knew this movie was going to be a ride. i did not expect it to become one of my favorite films of 2022, but it definitely. i really hope it wins best animated feature at the academy awards this year. dreamworks deserves this one. check it out as soon as you can."

","in an age when movie and tv franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (i'm looking at you, disney), i don't think anyone was expecting much from puss in boots: the last wish - certainly not i.after the first 5 minutes, i knew this was something special.firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from arkane and enter the spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. the 2d elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.the music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).the dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling i think i've ever seen. in a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. the cast do a great job of selling them too. goldi and the bears come out with brilliant british-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.and then there's the wolf. this character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. his style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, i'm serious).at a time when disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - dreamworks have taken on the mantle.it made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. you might think i'm overselling it, but hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.there are those that say that hollywood is done - i know i do. but dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

-the stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of shrek.-it's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-the fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-it feels like the first two shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. again, refreshing that they were able to step back.the designs changes to an extent
-creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-like into the spiderverse? good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that puss does.-not overused, which is very good for me.the action at times
-shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-this movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-the ending fight shows the potential of what dreamworks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes i've seen this year.the heart
-lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-the movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-there are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. that's hard to do in many things.-i love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-have not felt this way since shrek 2.dislikes:the darkness
-it's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.predictable
-the lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-the movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.too many antagonists
-one of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-they do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.the comedy is still tapered
-it's starting to go back to shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made shrek, shrek.-they took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.the animation changes at times
-the animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-the comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.the action still not complete
--shrek and shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-this movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-the stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-they sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-often was shorter than i wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.the verdict
i must say, puss in boots: the last wish was a much better film than when i walked in. perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. it evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. and it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. this film is indeed a solid return to the world and i had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. however, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance i was looking for. the movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with puss in boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. and the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the shrek that we saw in the first two movies. still, i do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

"1337","dune","wolfinflannel",2023-10-21,10," restored my faith in animated movies!
","puss and boots: the last wish was a true 'feel good' movie. the plot was well thought out and transitioned flawlessly from the last puss and boots film. what made this different from the previous movie is the mature theme and sentiments that made the film enjoyable and illuminating for all ages. the story progression was smooth and did not make the movie feel too short or too long. the story's theme (life is too short, so we must value what we have) flows through several different angles and characters throughout the story. the theme is not lost during the movie and is carried by the protagonist's emotions and personal growth. the characters in this movie helped express the theme and made the film more enjoyable. puss was the perfect protagonist, and his personal growth in the movie showed the audience that it is never too late for a fresh start, especially given that his character did not transition from the last film to the beginning of this one. kitty and pedrito's contrasting personalities and feelings allow two perspectives to get through to puss and show him what it means to be a family. goldy and the three bears added an extra obstacle for 'team friendship' but highlighted the theme through their growth. death was a great character because he was simply doing his job and was the character that indirectly pushed puss to become a better person and respected him for it. jack horner was an excellent antagonist because he was indeed a villain. instead of a character that was hurt by society or had good intentions deep down, this character was a pure monster. it was refreshing to have a villain that everyone could get behind disliking. the dialogue in this movie was powerful. each sentence helped tell the story, and it did not feel like there were any filler lines. the comic relief was natural, and the emotional conversations were deep. the imagery and background in the film were well articulated and detailed. each setting aligned with the active story and flowed with the transitions. the background music of the story was also fitting; it added an extra layer for the viewer and did not distract them from the story. this movie gave hope for the future of animated movies in america."

","i have seen good movies in the year of 2022, but puss in boots: the last wish (2022) is by far the best animated movie of 2022 and is my favorite movie from that year. also, it is the best movie in the shrek franchise.the voice cast is great; antonio banderas as puss in boots was great, salma hayek was great, and harvey guill√©n as perrito was great because they are good characters, and they are funny. florence pugh as goldilocks, olivia colman as mama bear, ray winstone as papa bear, and samson kayo as baby bear were funny, and they were also good characters.there is this wolf villain in the movie that is legit creepy, was such a cool character. he does certain things that makes him a great villain for puss in boots to go against, and he is voiced by wagner moura who has a great voice for this character.the animation is beautiful in this movie; it has amazing action scenes, pretty scenery, and imaginable locations that look great in this animation style. the movie is also creative in how it uses fairytale locations and items from those stories, which is what makes another villain character voiced by john mulaney funny to watch.the movie has a simple plot but does it in a creative way with great characters, and some little references to shrek. what i especially loved was how puss in boots starts laughing in the face of danger, but because he is on his last life, he starts getting scared and starts thinking about what he has done with his earlier lives and how spent them.i had a fun time with puss in boots: the last wish (2022); it has fantastic animation, it was funny, it has great characters, it has great emotional moments, and there are great action scenes. i highly recommend checking this movie out because you will have gun with it, and i am excited to see this movie again when i get the chance."
"1343","dune","jakebunker",2023-07-08,10," believe the hype
","this is the best animated feature since into the spider-verse, and probably better than toy story 4 and soul. i don't find many movies rewatchable nowadays and this is one of the few. not only is it a visual masterpiece (huge credit to the animators, well done!) but from a critical standpoint is has extremely well done characters, an engaging and relatable story, and takes very bold actions that will leave animation-lovers stunned for years to come. spoilers would be ruining an experience that you simply must witness for yourself, so what are you waiting for? believe the hype, go watch it if you haven't already! 9.5/10 but imma round up.edit: i've given it a year and came back to it and it's just even better the second viewing. in my opinion this is dreamwork's greatest movie (especially if you take away the first 5 minutes), better than kung fu panda, how to train your dragon, even prince of egypt. also the only dreamworks movie that i think deserves a 10/10. it's one thing to make an actually good and compelling story but to be also very entertaining and engaging for everyone is another feat. the user ratings and critics ratings are way too low. most criticisms of the movie are, imo, flawed, non-existent or biased. i sincerely cannot recommend this movie enough."
"1344","dune","soumikbanerjee1996",2023-01-12,8," one darn good entertainer!

'the last wish' may not be among the best films i have ever seen, but it is an interesting and enjoyable watch for sure.the visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the blend of two distinct animation art styles makes for an interesting cinematic experience, the score, too, sprinkled its fair share of magic, and on top of that, the characters are more fleshed out, unlike the last time, and the inclusion of 'perrito' and 'death' brought radical changes to the narrative, their mere presence made this more exciting."

","after losing his eighth life to a bell falling on top of him, puss in boots is down to his last life. an encounter from a vicious bounty hunter with a frightening presence destroys his confidence and for the first time, he feels fear. after escaping by the skin of his teeth, he decides he is no longer worthy of the name puss in boots and begins life as an adopted cat. he learns about the dark forest where someone can make a wish on the wishing star. with this in mind, the crafty feline returns to adventure to get his lives back.a little late to review this movie, but i still caught it in theaters. i knew from the trailer that this would be a cool movie. at first, i was wondering why dreamworks is creating another puss in boots movie. it feels weird to make a sequel to a spin-off that came out over a decade ago. as someone who has not watched the original puss in boots, i do not think you need to watch the original to get what is going on here aside from maybe puss' relationship with kitty softpaws. with that said, let me tell you how good this movie is!puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animated films. first of all, the animation looks absolutely stunning. the movie has probably the best animation from a cgi film i have ever seen. not only do the movement and expressions look smooth and crisp, the cinematography and imagery looks amazing and memorable too. there are many awesome shots in this film such as a shot of puss staring in the eyes of death. these shots strengthen the emotional moments and even some of the funny moments as well. every shot in this movie looks awesome. the animation really shows its fluidity in the action scenes. this movie has better action than 90% percent of the live-action blockbusters out there. the set pieces are so dynamic and entertaining that there is not a boring moment in the film. the opening set piece sets the tone for the entire movie and from that point forward, i knew i was in for a ride. the soundtrack is awesome too from the catchy score to the fun opening song for puss in boots.fantastic visuals aside, the story is memorable too. this movie pushes its pg rating. there is blood, cursing and dark themes that may frighten younger viewers. the story is about how puss is reacting to the idea that he is on deaths door. if he dies one more time, he will be gone forever. this is a movie where we see one of the coolest and most confident characters in animation lose his confidence. with that, he has a character arc that gives him depths and flaws that are relatable so even when he does something kind of selfish, you can still sympathize with his motivations. this movie has a lot of stylish action and funny jokes, but the scenes revolving around the wolf ramp up the dark tone of the movie. it never loses its sense of humor and this is one funny movie. i love the snarky dialogue, perrito gets one scene with goldilocks and the three bears that steals the show comedy wise. this movie has the perfect mix of comedy, action, drama and emotional moments to make it stand out.in addition to a great story, the cast of characters are memorable too. puss is at his best. he is the same awesome and adorable character from shrek, but he is given a lot of vulnerability here. he starts out as this arrogant, but powerful guy who can take down giants, but when he sees that death is coming for him, you can see how it shakes him to the core. his friends kitty softpaws and especially perrito are great characters too. perrito seems like the guy that would annoy everyone, but he is a great support character who is hilarious and just plain adorable. he is also surprisingly aware of emotions. there is one scene with him and puss that warmed my heart.as for the antagonists, the wolf is one of my favorite antagonists in an animated film. he has a badass voice, he completely changes the tone of the movie and he wipes out puss' bravado entirely and reduces him to a frightened cat. he is also a great fighter, but it is his presence, voice, dialogue and whistle that make him truly memorable. kids might have nightmares because of him. goldilocks and the three bears are fun anti-villains that have a sweet bond with each other. then there is the gluttonous scumbag jack horner. this is the character the writers decided to just make as hilariously hatable and disgusting as possible. they make no attempt to give this guy any sympathetic trait and i love it. we need more outright terrible people in new animated films. he is a funny villain with how unapologetic he is towards his minions, but you will be actively rooting for this character's demise.every single character in this film is memorable to a degree. it helps that the voice acting in this movie is excellent with antonio banderas as puss, salma hayek as kitty, harvey gull√©n as perrito, john mulaney as jack horner and especially wagner moura as the wolf. moura might have one of the best voices for a villain in animation i have seen in a while. each person brings their character to life in this movie. i can see any main character here being someone's favorite in the movie. that is how you know that you have a great cast.there is not a dull moment in this movie. puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animation and more. i did not expect a movie like this to be that great, but when i saw the trailers with the gorgeous animation, i knew this movie was going to be a ride. i did not expect it to become one of my favorite films of 2022, but it definitely. i really hope it wins best animated feature at the academy awards this year. dreamworks deserves this one. check it out as soon as you can."

","wow ! dreamsworks has always been good with sequels and i think it is safe to say this might be their best sequel to date .without giving much of the plot there are many new characters and fairy tales introduced here and they actually help elevate the story alongside with being so cute ,loveable and hilarious .appealing to both kids and adults ,this movie was a treat ,it mixes being a fun continuation to the story without repeating the same tropes of the first movie and also handles heavy topics without feeling grim ,dark or taking itself too seriously.highly recommended and worth every penny üëå"

","in an age when movie and tv franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (i'm looking at you, disney), i don't think anyone was expecting much from puss in boots: the last wish - certainly not i.after the first 5 minutes, i knew this was something special.firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from arkane and enter the spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. the 2d elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.the music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).the dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling i think i've ever seen. in a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. the cast do a great job of selling them too. goldi and the bears come out with brilliant british-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.and then there's the wolf. this character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. his style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, i'm serious).at a time when disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - dreamworks have taken on the mantle.it made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. you might think i'm overselling it, but hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.there are those that say that hollywood is done - i know i do. but dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."
"1358","dune","thezodiacdozenbooks",2022-12-21,10," the best movie in the entire shrek franchise!
","you heard me! my wife and i just got back from the theater, and absolutely loved this movie, even more than any of the shrek movies and the first puss in boots!this movie has so much to love, from beautiful visuals/action to consistent humor that actually had us laughing to engaging characters, both old and new. such a fun time, and so worth seeing in the theaters, though we'll definitely be picking up a copy once it's out on dvd!without giving too much away, there are several different antagonists in this movie that scratch all the bad-guy itches, covering the spectrum from totally hateable to horrifying to relatable and sympathetic. a great cast! also, the magical world they came up with for this movie was awesome, with some really cool/unique features!at first, we were a little worried about the dog character, neither of us being big fans of daffy sidekicks, but we were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves rooting for him! he's hilarious, and that's coming from a cat-lover!several callbacks to the first puss in boots movie made this one feel less like a spin-off than a worthy standalone franchise, and the movie was packed with magical references that all ages will be able to recognize and enjoy.do yourself a favor and free a few hours for this one!! a rare 10 from me!!"

","it is beyond crazy how good this movie was. the character development was so very well-done, puss experiencing fear for the first time, and his fear of mortality was so palpable, well, reasoned and relatable.death's characterizations was on point, his motivation made complete sense, and he was really horrifying, i totally understood why puss was so afraid of him.the side characters were all likeable. the dog was a delight, and the bear family's arc was genuinely touching with several emotional moments.they also landed the ending, and the final shot not only gave me major pirates of the carribbean vibes, it also gave me so much hope for what's to come. i would be happy if they made another installment."

","likes:pacing
-very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.adorable characters/feel
-new characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-the feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-has that element of shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.the animation
-it's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy dreamworks does so well.-the design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-the world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that i certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-and it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than disney for the blend of real and cartoons.the voice acting:
-many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that snl like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. he own the horner character and brought some of the best lines.-wagner moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the big-bad wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-pugh is okay, not my favorite role as goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. it does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-banderas takes boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the spanish stereotype. and yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.the references/jokes
-the stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of shrek.-it's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-the fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-it feels like the first two shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. again, refreshing that they were able to step back.the designs changes to an extent
-creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-like into the spiderverse? good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that puss does.-not overused, which is very good for me.the action at times
-shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-this movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-the ending fight shows the potential of what dreamworks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes i've seen this year.the heart
-lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-the movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-there are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. that's hard to do in many things.-i love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-have not felt this way since shrek 2.dislikes:the darkness
-it's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.predictable
-the lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-the movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.too many antagonists
-one of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-they do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.the comedy is still tapered
-it's starting to go back to shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made shrek, shrek.-they took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.the animation changes at times
-the animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-the comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.the action still not complete
--shrek and shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-this movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-the stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-they sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-often was shorter than i wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.the verdict
i must say, puss in boots: the last wish was a much better film than when i walked in. perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. it evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. and it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. this film is indeed a solid return to the world and i had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. however, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance i was looking for. the movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with puss in boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. and the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the shrek that we saw in the first two movies. still, i do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

"1362","dune","wolfinflannel",2023-10-21,10," restored my faith in animated movies!
","puss and boots: the last wish was a true 'feel good' movie. the plot was well thought out and transitioned flawlessly from the last puss and boots film. what made this different from the previous movie is the mature theme and sentiments that made the film enjoyable and illuminating for all ages. the story progression was smooth and did not make the movie feel too short or too long. the story's theme (life is too short, so we must value what we have) flows through several different angles and characters throughout the story. the theme is not lost during the movie and is carried by the protagonist's emotions and personal growth. the characters in this movie helped express the theme and made the film more enjoyable. puss was the perfect protagonist, and his personal growth in the movie showed the audience that it is never too late for a fresh start, especially given that his character did not transition from the last film to the beginning of this one. kitty and pedrito's contrasting personalities and feelings allow two perspectives to get through to puss and show him what it means to be a family. goldy and the three bears added an extra obstacle for 'team friendship' but highlighted the theme through their growth. death was a great character because he was simply doing his job and was the character that indirectly pushed puss to become a better person and respected him for it. jack horner was an excellent antagonist because he was indeed a villain. instead of a character that was hurt by society or had good intentions deep down, this character was a pure monster. it was refreshing to have a villain that everyone could get behind disliking. the dialogue in this movie was powerful. each sentence helped tell the story, and it did not feel like there were any filler lines. the comic relief was natural, and the emotional conversations were deep. the imagery and background in the film were well articulated and detailed. each setting aligned with the active story and flowed with the transitions. the background music of the story was also fitting; it added an extra layer for the viewer and did not distract them from the story. this movie gave hope for the future of animated movies in america."

","i have seen good movies in the year of 2022, but puss in boots: the last wish (2022) is by far the best animated movie of 2022 and is my favorite movie from that year. also, it is the best movie in the shrek franchise.the voice cast is great; antonio banderas as puss in boots was great, salma hayek was great, and harvey guill√©n as perrito was great because they are good characters, and they are funny. florence pugh as goldilocks, olivia colman as mama bear, ray winstone as papa bear, and samson kayo as baby bear were funny, and they were also good characters.there is this wolf villain in the movie that is legit creepy, was such a cool character. he does certain things that makes him a great villain for puss in boots to go against, and he is voiced by wagner moura who has a great voice for this character.the animation is beautiful in this movie; it has amazing action scenes, pretty scenery, and imaginable locations that look great in this animation style. the movie is also creative in how it uses fairytale locations and items from those stories, which is what makes another villain character voiced by john mulaney funny to watch.the movie has a simple plot but does it in a creative way with great characters, and some little references to shrek. what i especially loved was how puss in boots starts laughing in the face of danger, but because he is on his last life, he starts getting scared and starts thinking about what he has done with his earlier lives and how spent them.i had a fun time with puss in boots: the last wish (2022); it has fantastic animation, it was funny, it has great characters, it has great emotional moments, and there are great action scenes. i highly recommend checking this movie out because you will have gun with it, and i am excited to see this movie again when i get the chance."

'the last wish' may not be among the best films i have ever seen, but it is an interesting and enjoyable watch for sure.the visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the blend of two distinct animation art styles makes for an interesting cinematic experience, the score, too, sprinkled its fair share of magic, and on top of that, the characters are more fleshed out, unlike the last time, and the inclusion of 'perrito' and 'death' brought radical changes to the narrative, their mere presence made this more exciting."

","after losing his eighth life to a bell falling on top of him, puss in boots is down to his last life. an encounter from a vicious bounty hunter with a frightening presence destroys his confidence and for the first time, he feels fear. after escaping by the skin of his teeth, he decides he is no longer worthy of the name puss in boots and begins life as an adopted cat. he learns about the dark forest where someone can make a wish on the wishing star. with this in mind, the crafty feline returns to adventure to get his lives back.a little late to review this movie, but i still caught it in theaters. i knew from the trailer that this would be a cool movie. at first, i was wondering why dreamworks is creating another puss in boots movie. it feels weird to make a sequel to a spin-off that came out over a decade ago. as someone who has not watched the original puss in boots, i do not think you need to watch the original to get what is going on here aside from maybe puss' relationship with kitty softpaws. with that said, let me tell you how good this movie is!puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animated films. first of all, the animation looks absolutely stunning. the movie has probably the best animation from a cgi film i have ever seen. not only do the movement and expressions look smooth and crisp, the cinematography and imagery looks amazing and memorable too. there are many awesome shots in this film such as a shot of puss staring in the eyes of death. these shots strengthen the emotional moments and even some of the funny moments as well. every shot in this movie looks awesome. the animation really shows its fluidity in the action scenes. this movie has better action than 90% percent of the live-action blockbusters out there. the set pieces are so dynamic and entertaining that there is not a boring moment in the film. the opening set piece sets the tone for the entire movie and from that point forward, i knew i was in for a ride. the soundtrack is awesome too from the catchy score to the fun opening song for puss in boots.fantastic visuals aside, the story is memorable too. this movie pushes its pg rating. there is blood, cursing and dark themes that may frighten younger viewers. the story is about how puss is reacting to the idea that he is on deaths door. if he dies one more time, he will be gone forever. this is a movie where we see one of the coolest and most confident characters in animation lose his confidence. with that, he has a character arc that gives him depths and flaws that are relatable so even when he does something kind of selfish, you can still sympathize with his motivations. this movie has a lot of stylish action and funny jokes, but the scenes revolving around the wolf ramp up the dark tone of the movie. it never loses its sense of humor and this is one funny movie. i love the snarky dialogue, perrito gets one scene with goldilocks and the three bears that steals the show comedy wise. this movie has the perfect mix of comedy, action, drama and emotional moments to make it stand out.in addition to a great story, the cast of characters are memorable too. puss is at his best. he is the same awesome and adorable character from shrek, but he is given a lot of vulnerability here. he starts out as this arrogant, but powerful guy who can take down giants, but when he sees that death is coming for him, you can see how it shakes him to the core. his friends kitty softpaws and especially perrito are great characters too. perrito seems like the guy that would annoy everyone, but he is a great support character who is hilarious and just plain adorable. he is also surprisingly aware of emotions. there is one scene with him and puss that warmed my heart.as for the antagonists, the wolf is one of my favorite antagonists in an animated film. he has a badass voice, he completely changes the tone of the movie and he wipes out puss' bravado entirely and reduces him to a frightened cat. he is also a great fighter, but it is his presence, voice, dialogue and whistle that make him truly memorable. kids might have nightmares because of him. goldilocks and the three bears are fun anti-villains that have a sweet bond with each other. then there is the gluttonous scumbag jack horner. this is the character the writers decided to just make as hilariously hatable and disgusting as possible. they make no attempt to give this guy any sympathetic trait and i love it. we need more outright terrible people in new animated films. he is a funny villain with how unapologetic he is towards his minions, but you will be actively rooting for this character's demise.every single character in this film is memorable to a degree. it helps that the voice acting in this movie is excellent with antonio banderas as puss, salma hayek as kitty, harvey gull√©n as perrito, john mulaney as jack horner and especially wagner moura as the wolf. moura might have one of the best voices for a villain in animation i have seen in a while. each person brings their character to life in this movie. i can see any main character here being someone's favorite in the movie. that is how you know that you have a great cast.there is not a dull moment in this movie. puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animation and more. i did not expect a movie like this to be that great, but when i saw the trailers with the gorgeous animation, i knew this movie was going to be a ride. i did not expect it to become one of my favorite films of 2022, but it definitely. i really hope it wins best animated feature at the academy awards this year. dreamworks deserves this one. check it out as soon as you can."

","i liked emerald fennell's first feature, a promising young woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. in this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the british aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.the plot is essentially that of a talented mr ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. the directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.there's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. the acting is excellent however - barry keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. rosamund pike is also superb as the matriarch. a cameo by carey mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.the plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the british upper class - but with not much class.if you like pretentious arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you. but if you prefer to be allowed to concentrate on the unfolding tale of immorality without the shock and awe, then ttmr is a far better movie."

my rating 9/10
in selected cinemas nowsaltburn is the latest movie from the brilliant creative writer, director , producer and actress emerald fennell since her 2020 triumphant movie essay on vengeance promising young woman which starred her friend carey mulligan.carey mulligan only plays a cameo role in saltburn but what a brilliant cameo role it is of poor dear pamela the unwanted dysfunctional house guest.carey mulligan in an interview with margo robbie a co producer of saltburn said that the role emerald fennell originally offered her was not the one she ended up playing. on reading the script carey mulligan said she decided that she wanted to play poor dear pamela and emerald agreed to her request .i'm only assuming the other role offered to her was that of lady elspeth catton played in the movie to perfection by oscar nominee rosamund pike.this movie in fact has four oscar nominees in the cast richard e. grant, barry keoghan, carey mulligan and rosamund pike.it's no wonder to me that emerald fennell it's creator has received numerous accolades, including an academy award, two british academy film awards, one screen actors guild award, and nominations for three primetime emmy awards and three golden globe awards.one reviewer described this movie as a promising young man takes a seedy turn as it follows a young university student who becomes infatuated with his aristocratic schoolmate and his wealthy but eccentric family.my only regret with this movie is the fact that emerald fennell chose the 1.33:1 aspect ratio , her reason being that it gives the impression of ""peeping in.""
the magnificent cinematography by linus sandgren in my opinion deserves the full anamorphic 2.39:1 widescreen aspect.i call this movie an art house black comedy thriller if i had to describe it in a few words i think i would say it's brideshead revisited with the style of peter greenaway the avant- garde director of famous 1980's movies like the draughtsman's contract , drowning by numbers and the cook, the thief, his wife & her lover .this wonderful movie for me was a complete surprise and is now in my top 5 films of 2023 . it may not the be finest of the year but certainly the most original and entertaining in my opinion.not everyone will share my view but i adore clever screenplays about the psychology and obsessional aspects of the human mind especially when tinged with black humour.i couldn't help thinking of evelyn waugh's brideshead revisited while watching saltburn so after seeing the movie i wasn't surprised to read that emerald fennell recommended jacob elordi the brisbane born handsome actor read brideshead revisited to prepare for this important role in his career .in complete contrast jacob will be playing elvis presley in the forthcoming movie pricilla based on the early relationship of pricilla beaulieu and elvis .in saltburn jacob elordi plays the pivotal character of everyone's affection felix catton the son and heir of sir james catton played with delicious detachment by richard e grant and elspeth catton perfectly cast with the glamorous rosamund pike .rosamund pike has never looked as glamorous in a movie her gowns and all the costumes designed by sophie canale who was assistant costume designer on bridgerton are outstanding especially in the spectacular fancy dress masquerade birthday party scene in honour of the family interloper oliver quick also played to perfection by the academy award nominated irish supporting actor barry keoghan in the banshees of inisherin barry keoghan.barry keoghan's character oliver quick is the cuckoo in this nest of privilege , an intelligent young man from a middle class family studying at oxford not because of family wealth but on a scholarship .his character appears benign at first but gradually develops into a complex and devilishly ambitious assault on the upper class family whose hospitality and wealth turns his summer of love into a quest of betrayal.the movie begins with oliver's narrative explaining his obsessional affection for the charismatic felix catton whose life ,family and popularity starkly contrasts oliver's nerdy dullness . oliver through a set of careful manoeuvres manages to enter the world of felix catton and his aristocratic eccentric family.similar to brideshead felix invites oliver to spend the summer at his family's ancestral home saltbush where he is welcomed by the glamorous matriarch elspeth .no spoilers everyone should experience this amazing movie with fresh eyes preferably on a cinema screen as it may look very boxy on a television screen.as mentioned the sets and location shooting are stunning and feature the historic cobbled radcliffe square in oxford and its walled surroundings and colleges.the stately home that emerald fennell chose as saltburn is drayton house in northamptonshire and has never been used for filming before and may never be used again
i haven't mentioned many of the brilliant ensemble cast but the two standouts for me were archie madekwe as the young border at saltburn farleigh start who sees through oliver quick and becomes an object of jealousy.also the beautiful but troubled daughter of the household annabelle played by sadie soverall all the performances including the supercilious scene stealing butler played by paul rhys are wonderful.i'd love to spend a day in emerald fennels mind the characters that inhabit it in the stories she creates in killing eve ,promising young woman and now saltburn i find fascinating."

","saltburn is a story about oliver, portrayed by barry keoghan(love him, who doesn't? i've seen killing of a sacred deer at least 10 times).his infatuation with felix catton, which starts at oxford, quickly spirals into an obsession, leading to some morally ambiguous, if not outright disturbing, choices. what starts as a seemingly innocent attraction, soon morphs into something dark and uncontrollable.what struck me most about saltburn is its clever use of greek mythology as a narrative tool. the parallels drawn between oliver's actions and the story of theseus and the minotaur add a rich layer of symbolism. this mythological reference isn't just a backdrop; it's integral to understanding oliver's character and his journey.the film also delves into the themes of social class and the dichotomy between public persona and private reality. in an age where social media often dictates how we present ourselves to the world, 'saltburn' offers a critical, if not cynical, view of this duality. oliver's character becomes a vessel for exploring these themes, making us question the authenticity of those around us.director emerald fennell doesn't shy away from making bold choices in 'saltburn,' particularly in how the story unfolds. some may find the film's progression and its eventual climax a bit jarring, but i believe it adds to the film's uniqueness. the narrative isn't straightforward, and it's this complexity that makes 'saltburn' stand out.the performances in the film are noteworthy. barry keoghan delivers a nuanced portrayal of oliver, balancing vulnerability with an underlying sense of menace. the supporting cast, including jacob elordi and rosamund pike, also contribute significantly to the film's overall impact. i've been skeptical of them, but i was impressed.in conclusion, saltburn is a thought-provoking film that challenges conventional storytelling. it's a blend of mythology and modernity, a narrative that forces us to confront the darker aspects of desire and ambition. while it may not be everyone's cup of tea (i was grossed out by two scenes, you know the ones), for those who appreciate a film that makes you think and re-evaluate, saltburn is definitely worth a watch. i've been skeptical of them, but i was impressed."

","greetings again from the darkness. emerald fennell won an oscar for her original screenplay of her dark and divisive debut feature film, promising young woman (2020). she's back as writer-director of her second feature film, and it's every bit as dark, and even more scathing in its takedown of the rich and entitled. we are also treated to yet another awkwardly disturbed character for the growing resume of barry keoghan.oliver quick (keoghan) is a newly arrived student of the class of 2006 at oxford, and it's clear from the first moment that he doesn't really fit in, whether it's his clothes, not smoking, his uneasiness with his tutor, or his social ineptness. he becomes transfixed on the bmoc, felix catton (jacob elordi, fresh off his turn as elvis in priscilla). felix is tall, handsome, charming, and rich. life comes easy for him, and students are drawn to him - both male and female. he's a modern-day aristocrat, and one day oliver helps him out of a jam. this leads to a bonding, or more like worlds colliding. the first act is devoted to the development of this unexpected friendship, and leads to felix inviting oliver to spend the summer at his family estate ... saltburn.saltburn is nothing short of a magnificent castle. felix's eccentric family includes farleigh (archie madekwe, gran turismo), an adopted ""cousin"" fellow oxfor student who sees all but would never blow this gig; venetia (alison oliver), the total mess of a daughter and sister; poor dear pamela (carey mulligan), the total mess of a houseguest who has overstayed her welcome; sir james catton (richard e grant), the childlike father; and espeth catton (rosamund pike), the former model drama queen passive-aggressive mother. it's a motley crew that puts 'the royal tenenbaums' to shame for entitlement.as the summer progresses, we see oliver in action as he weasels his way into the good graces of some, while creating leverage over others. his non-descript looks, quiet demeanor, and background story lead some to protect him at the same time others distrust him. as viewers, it's obvious to us that something isn't right with oliver, yet director fennell and keoghan's performance keeps us hopeful that things won't become too skewed. those hopes are dashed once we see keoghan's first bathtub scene (and subsequent disturbing moments), and fennell serves up multiple references to his mouth in letting us know it's not to be trusted.the third act goes full dark in a deliciously wicked manner with fennell and oscar winning cinematographer linus sandgren (la la land) creating an old world style within a contemporary world. the film is perfectly cast with elordi quite magnetic as felix, the not-so-obscure object of oliver's desire. madekwe is spot on as the turf-protecting farleigh, and grant and pike make the perfectly mismatched couple of privilege. alison oliver delivers the film's best scene with her bathtub monologue, while keoghan nails the creepy oliver (in line with his roles in the banshees of inisherin, the killing of a sacred deer, and the batman. he has become the go-to psychopath. he even combines humor and horror for his happy naked castle dance in this film that has the talented mr ripley (1999) as its most obvious comparison. ms. fennell strikes another blow against the entitled elite, although we do wish she hadn't spelled out everything to end the film ... a bit of mystique would have worked.opening in theaters on november 22, 2023."

my rating 9/10
in selected cinemas nowsaltburn is the latest movie from the brilliant creative writer, director , producer and actress emerald fennell since her 2020 triumphant movie essay on vengeance promising young woman which starred her friend carey mulligan.carey mulligan only plays a cameo role in saltburn but what a brilliant cameo role it is of poor dear pamela the unwanted dysfunctional house guest.carey mulligan in an interview with margo robbie a co producer of saltburn said that the role emerald fennell originally offered her was not the one she ended up playing. on reading the script carey mulligan said she decided that she wanted to play poor dear pamela and emerald agreed to her request .i'm only assuming the other role offered to her was that of lady elspeth catton played in the movie to perfection by oscar nominee rosamund pike.this movie in fact has four oscar nominees in the cast richard e. grant, barry keoghan, carey mulligan and rosamund pike.it's no wonder to me that emerald fennell it's creator has received numerous accolades, including an academy award, two british academy film awards, one screen actors guild award, and nominations for three primetime emmy awards and three golden globe awards.one reviewer described this movie as a promising young man takes a seedy turn as it follows a young university student who becomes infatuated with his aristocratic schoolmate and his wealthy but eccentric family.my only regret with this movie is the fact that emerald fennell chose the 1.33:1 aspect ratio , her reason being that it gives the impression of ""peeping in.""
the magnificent cinematography by linus sandgren in my opinion deserves the full anamorphic 2.39:1 widescreen aspect.i call this movie an art house black comedy thriller if i had to describe it in a few words i think i would say it's brideshead revisited with the style of peter greenaway the avant- garde director of famous 1980's movies like the draughtsman's contract , drowning by numbers and the cook, the thief, his wife & her lover .this wonderful movie for me was a complete surprise and is now in my top 5 films of 2023 . it may not the be finest of the year but certainly the most original and entertaining in my opinion.not everyone will share my view but i adore clever screenplays about the psychology and obsessional aspects of the human mind especially when tinged with black humour.i couldn't help thinking of evelyn waugh's brideshead revisited while watching saltburn so after seeing the movie i wasn't surprised to read that emerald fennell recommended jacob elordi the brisbane born handsome actor read brideshead revisited to prepare for this important role in his career .in complete contrast jacob will be playing elvis presley in the forthcoming movie pricilla based on the early relationship of pricilla beaulieu and elvis .in saltburn jacob elordi plays the pivotal character of everyone's affection felix catton the son and heir of sir james catton played with delicious detachment by richard e grant and elspeth catton perfectly cast with the glamorous rosamund pike .rosamund pike has never looked as glamorous in a movie her gowns and all the costumes designed by sophie canale who was assistant costume designer on bridgerton are outstanding especially in the spectacular fancy dress masquerade birthday party scene in honour of the family interloper oliver quick also played to perfection by the academy award nominated irish supporting actor barry keoghan in the banshees of inisherin barry keoghan.barry keoghan's character oliver quick is the cuckoo in this nest of privilege , an intelligent young man from a middle class family studying at oxford not because of family wealth but on a scholarship .his character appears benign at first but gradually develops into a complex and devilishly ambitious assault on the upper class family whose hospitality and wealth turns his summer of love into a quest of betrayal.the movie begins with oliver's narrative explaining his obsessional affection for the charismatic felix catton whose life ,family and popularity starkly contrasts oliver's nerdy dullness . oliver through a set of careful manoeuvres manages to enter the world of felix catton and his aristocratic eccentric family.similar to brideshead felix invites oliver to spend the summer at his family's ancestral home saltbush where he is welcomed by the glamorous matriarch elspeth .no spoilers everyone should experience this amazing movie with fresh eyes preferably on a cinema screen as it may look very boxy on a television screen.as mentioned the sets and location shooting are stunning and feature the historic cobbled radcliffe square in oxford and its walled surroundings and colleges.the stately home that emerald fennell chose as saltburn is drayton house in northamptonshire and has never been used for filming before and may never be used again
i haven't mentioned many of the brilliant ensemble cast but the two standouts for me were archie madekwe as the young border at saltburn farleigh start who sees through oliver quick and becomes an object of jealousy.also the beautiful but troubled daughter of the household annabelle played by sadie soverall all the performances including the supercilious scene stealing butler played by paul rhys are wonderful.i'd love to spend a day in emerald fennels mind the characters that inhabit it in the stories she creates in killing eve ,promising young woman and now saltburn i find fascinating."

","saltburn is a story about oliver, portrayed by barry keoghan(love him, who doesn't? i've seen killing of a sacred deer at least 10 times).his infatuation with felix catton, which starts at oxford, quickly spirals into an obsession, leading to some morally ambiguous, if not outright disturbing, choices. what starts as a seemingly innocent attraction, soon morphs into something dark and uncontrollable.what struck me most about saltburn is its clever use of greek mythology as a narrative tool. the parallels drawn between oliver's actions and the story of theseus and the minotaur add a rich layer of symbolism. this mythological reference isn't just a backdrop; it's integral to understanding oliver's character and his journey.the film also delves into the themes of social class and the dichotomy between public persona and private reality. in an age where social media often dictates how we present ourselves to the world, 'saltburn' offers a critical, if not cynical, view of this duality. oliver's character becomes a vessel for exploring these themes, making us question the authenticity of those around us.director emerald fennell doesn't shy away from making bold choices in 'saltburn,' particularly in how the story unfolds. some may find the film's progression and its eventual climax a bit jarring, but i believe it adds to the film's uniqueness. the narrative isn't straightforward, and it's this complexity that makes 'saltburn' stand out.the performances in the film are noteworthy. barry keoghan delivers a nuanced portrayal of oliver, balancing vulnerability with an underlying sense of menace. the supporting cast, including jacob elordi and rosamund pike, also contribute significantly to the film's overall impact. i've been skeptical of them, but i was impressed.in conclusion, saltburn is a thought-provoking film that challenges conventional storytelling. it's a blend of mythology and modernity, a narrative that forces us to confront the darker aspects of desire and ambition. while it may not be everyone's cup of tea (i was grossed out by two scenes, you know the ones), for those who appreciate a film that makes you think and re-evaluate, saltburn is definitely worth a watch. i've been skeptical of them, but i was impressed."

","it doesn't take long to realist that there is nothing particularly original in the plot of this movie. more or less from the outset it promises to be a more debauched, british version of the talented mr ripley, and ultimately it never strays too far from that tag.having thus tempered expectations, there is enough in the first hour or so of this film to offer some encouragement that the film could at least be watchable.our protagonist oliver (barry keoghan) is a scholarship boy at oxford. initially ostracised from the in-crowd by his lack of wealth or social grace, he works his way into the orbit of the charming, dashing and rich felix (jacob elordi), and is ultimately invited to the titular family home. there he is introduced to the bizarre world of the british aristocracy and the idiosyncratic characters that populate it.having established this fish-out-of-water narrative, and despite the sterling efforts of its cast, the plot then begins to drift. we are offered glimpses of what might have been - the relationship between oliver and felix's sister venetia (alison oliver), in particular, briefly offers opportunity for real interest and intrigue - but the film eschews these in favour of a far more well-worn and unchallenging path.as a consequence, the second half of the film - which is written to be rich in twists, reveals and shocks - becomes bland, predictable and - frankly - boring.there are strong performances throughout the film - rosamund pike, as felix's mother, is particularly engaging and amusing, and attempts admirably to carry much of the second half of the film. jacob elordi, though slightly unconvincing as a british aristocrat, looks nevertheless to have a bright future ahead of him. richard e. grant, as felix's father, is good value as well, even if his character is a little one-dimensional.and there are interesting characters who are never properly explored. pamela (carey mulligan) is a guest at saltburn who has overstayed her welcome, but is discarded as swiftly as she is introduced. farleigh (archie madekwe) is oliver's rival for felix's attention and funding, and provides a character that is well-drawn, well-performed and interesting, but again disappears from view in the latter stages of the film. this is particularly disappointing as archie madekwe does a great job of balancing his character's contradictions: intellectual but belligerent, confident but desperate, charming but hostile.the final result has some strong moments and some good performances, but ultimately fails to develop into a worthy film. at 2 hours and 7 minutes in length, it feels at least half an hour too long, and i confess it was ultimately a relief to finally be able to leave the cinema."

","quick review: i loved emerald phannell's debut film 'promising young woman'. it was hard to believe it was a debut feature. i hadn't even heard she was doing a follow-up film until suddenly i was watching it as the secret screening at fantastic fest. needless to say it blew me away. this was a terrific film experience.i think the thing i love most about phannell's work is the attention and care she gives to every character. there are no throwaway character's in these movies. everyone has a purpose and every character is fascinating in their own way.when that's the case it can be hard to single out a particularly good character/performance, and really everyone here was worthy of mention, but in particular i have to bring up rosamund pike. she stole every scene she was in. also barry keoghan is fast becoming the best actor working today. he is captivating to watch here.'saltburn' was such a pleasant surprise. i loved every minute of it and would highly recommend it. be warned though: this film is not afraid to go to some shocking places. 10/10."

","greetings again from the darkness. emerald fennell won an oscar for her original screenplay of her dark and divisive debut feature film, promising young woman (2020). she's back as writer-director of her second feature film, and it's every bit as dark, and even more scathing in its takedown of the rich and entitled. we are also treated to yet another awkwardly disturbed character for the growing resume of barry keoghan.oliver quick (keoghan) is a newly arrived student of the class of 2006 at oxford, and it's clear from the first moment that he doesn't really fit in, whether it's his clothes, not smoking, his uneasiness with his tutor, or his social ineptness. he becomes transfixed on the bmoc, felix catton (jacob elordi, fresh off his turn as elvis in priscilla). felix is tall, handsome, charming, and rich. life comes easy for him, and students are drawn to him - both male and female. he's a modern-day aristocrat, and one day oliver helps him out of a jam. this leads to a bonding, or more like worlds colliding. the first act is devoted to the development of this unexpected friendship, and leads to felix inviting oliver to spend the summer at his family estate ... saltburn.saltburn is nothing short of a magnificent castle. felix's eccentric family includes farleigh (archie madekwe, gran turismo), an adopted ""cousin"" fellow oxfor student who sees all but would never blow this gig; venetia (alison oliver), the total mess of a daughter and sister; poor dear pamela (carey mulligan), the total mess of a houseguest who has overstayed her welcome; sir james catton (richard e grant), the childlike father; and espeth catton (rosamund pike), the former model drama queen passive-aggressive mother. it's a motley crew that puts 'the royal tenenbaums' to shame for entitlement.as the summer progresses, we see oliver in action as he weasels his way into the good graces of some, while creating leverage over others. his non-descript looks, quiet demeanor, and background story lead some to protect him at the same time others distrust him. as viewers, it's obvious to us that something isn't right with oliver, yet director fennell and keoghan's performance keeps us hopeful that things won't become too skewed. those hopes are dashed once we see keoghan's first bathtub scene (and subsequent disturbing moments), and fennell serves up multiple references to his mouth in letting us know it's not to be trusted.the third act goes full dark in a deliciously wicked manner with fennell and oscar winning cinematographer linus sandgren (la la land) creating an old world style within a contemporary world. the film is perfectly cast with elordi quite magnetic as felix, the not-so-obscure object of oliver's desire. madekwe is spot on as the turf-protecting farleigh, and grant and pike make the perfectly mismatched couple of privilege. alison oliver delivers the film's best scene with her bathtub monologue, while keoghan nails the creepy oliver (in line with his roles in the banshees of inisherin, the killing of a sacred deer, and the batman. he has become the go-to psychopath. he even combines humor and horror for his happy naked castle dance in this film that has the talented mr ripley (1999) as its most obvious comparison. ms. fennell strikes another blow against the entitled elite, although we do wish she hadn't spelled out everything to end the film ... a bit of mystique would have worked.opening in theaters on november 22, 2023."

my rating 9/10
in selected cinemas nowsaltburn is the latest movie from the brilliant creative writer, director , producer and actress emerald fennell since her 2020 triumphant movie essay on vengeance promising young woman which starred her friend carey mulligan.carey mulligan only plays a cameo role in saltburn but what a brilliant cameo role it is of poor dear pamela the unwanted dysfunctional house guest.carey mulligan in an interview with margo robbie a co producer of saltburn said that the role emerald fennell originally offered her was not the one she ended up playing. on reading the script carey mulligan said she decided that she wanted to play poor dear pamela and emerald agreed to her request .i'm only assuming the other role offered to her was that of lady elspeth catton played in the movie to perfection by oscar nominee rosamund pike.this movie in fact has four oscar nominees in the cast richard e. grant, barry keoghan, carey mulligan and rosamund pike.it's no wonder to me that emerald fennell it's creator has received numerous accolades, including an academy award, two british academy film awards, one screen actors guild award, and nominations for three primetime emmy awards and three golden globe awards.one reviewer described this movie as a promising young man takes a seedy turn as it follows a young university student who becomes infatuated with his aristocratic schoolmate and his wealthy but eccentric family.my only regret with this movie is the fact that emerald fennell chose the 1.33:1 aspect ratio , her reason being that it gives the impression of ""peeping in.""
the magnificent cinematography by linus sandgren in my opinion deserves the full anamorphic 2.39:1 widescreen aspect.i call this movie an art house black comedy thriller if i had to describe it in a few words i think i would say it's brideshead revisited with the style of peter greenaway the avant- garde director of famous 1980's movies like the draughtsman's contract , drowning by numbers and the cook, the thief, his wife & her lover .this wonderful movie for me was a complete surprise and is now in my top 5 films of 2023 . it may not the be finest of the year but certainly the most original and entertaining in my opinion.not everyone will share my view but i adore clever screenplays about the psychology and obsessional aspects of the human mind especially when tinged with black humour.i couldn't help thinking of evelyn waugh's brideshead revisited while watching saltburn so after seeing the movie i wasn't surprised to read that emerald fennell recommended jacob elordi the brisbane born handsome actor read brideshead revisited to prepare for this important role in his career .in complete contrast jacob will be playing elvis presley in the forthcoming movie pricilla based on the early relationship of pricilla beaulieu and elvis .in saltburn jacob elordi plays the pivotal character of everyone's affection felix catton the son and heir of sir james catton played with delicious detachment by richard e grant and elspeth catton perfectly cast with the glamorous rosamund pike .rosamund pike has never looked as glamorous in a movie her gowns and all the costumes designed by sophie canale who was assistant costume designer on bridgerton are outstanding especially in the spectacular fancy dress masquerade birthday party scene in honour of the family interloper oliver quick also played to perfection by the academy award nominated irish supporting actor barry keoghan in the banshees of inisherin barry keoghan.barry keoghan's character oliver quick is the cuckoo in this nest of privilege , an intelligent young man from a middle class family studying at oxford not because of family wealth but on a scholarship .his character appears benign at first but gradually develops into a complex and devilishly ambitious assault on the upper class family whose hospitality and wealth turns his summer of love into a quest of betrayal.the movie begins with oliver's narrative explaining his obsessional affection for the charismatic felix catton whose life ,family and popularity starkly contrasts oliver's nerdy dullness . oliver through a set of careful manoeuvres manages to enter the world of felix catton and his aristocratic eccentric family.similar to brideshead felix invites oliver to spend the summer at his family's ancestral home saltbush where he is welcomed by the glamorous matriarch elspeth .no spoilers everyone should experience this amazing movie with fresh eyes preferably on a cinema screen as it may look very boxy on a television screen.as mentioned the sets and location shooting are stunning and feature the historic cobbled radcliffe square in oxford and its walled surroundings and colleges.the stately home that emerald fennell chose as saltburn is drayton house in northamptonshire and has never been used for filming before and may never be used again
i haven't mentioned many of the brilliant ensemble cast but the two standouts for me were archie madekwe as the young border at saltburn farleigh start who sees through oliver quick and becomes an object of jealousy.also the beautiful but troubled daughter of the household annabelle played by sadie soverall all the performances including the supercilious scene stealing butler played by paul rhys are wonderful.i'd love to spend a day in emerald fennels mind the characters that inhabit it in the stories she creates in killing eve ,promising young woman and now saltburn i find fascinating."

","saltburn is a story about oliver, portrayed by barry keoghan(love him, who doesn't? i've seen killing of a sacred deer at least 10 times).his infatuation with felix catton, which starts at oxford, quickly spirals into an obsession, leading to some morally ambiguous, if not outright disturbing, choices. what starts as a seemingly innocent attraction, soon morphs into something dark and uncontrollable.what struck me most about saltburn is its clever use of greek mythology as a narrative tool. the parallels drawn between oliver's actions and the story of theseus and the minotaur add a rich layer of symbolism. this mythological reference isn't just a backdrop; it's integral to understanding oliver's character and his journey.the film also delves into the themes of social class and the dichotomy between public persona and private reality. in an age where social media often dictates how we present ourselves to the world, 'saltburn' offers a critical, if not cynical, view of this duality. oliver's character becomes a vessel for exploring these themes, making us question the authenticity of those around us.director emerald fennell doesn't shy away from making bold choices in 'saltburn,' particularly in how the story unfolds. some may find the film's progression and its eventual climax a bit jarring, but i believe it adds to the film's uniqueness. the narrative isn't straightforward, and it's this complexity that makes 'saltburn' stand out.the performances in the film are noteworthy. barry keoghan delivers a nuanced portrayal of oliver, balancing vulnerability with an underlying sense of menace. the supporting cast, including jacob elordi and rosamund pike, also contribute significantly to the film's overall impact. i've been skeptical of them, but i was impressed.in conclusion, saltburn is a thought-provoking film that challenges conventional storytelling. it's a blend of mythology and modernity, a narrative that forces us to confront the darker aspects of desire and ambition. while it may not be everyone's cup of tea (i was grossed out by two scenes, you know the ones), for those who appreciate a film that makes you think and re-evaluate, saltburn is definitely worth a watch. i've been skeptical of them, but i was impressed."

","it doesn't take long to realist that there is nothing particularly original in the plot of this movie. more or less from the outset it promises to be a more debauched, british version of the talented mr ripley, and ultimately it never strays too far from that tag.having thus tempered expectations, there is enough in the first hour or so of this film to offer some encouragement that the film could at least be watchable.our protagonist oliver (barry keoghan) is a scholarship boy at oxford. initially ostracised from the in-crowd by his lack of wealth or social grace, he works his way into the orbit of the charming, dashing and rich felix (jacob elordi), and is ultimately invited to the titular family home. there he is introduced to the bizarre world of the british aristocracy and the idiosyncratic characters that populate it.having established this fish-out-of-water narrative, and despite the sterling efforts of its cast, the plot then begins to drift. we are offered glimpses of what might have been - the relationship between oliver and felix's sister venetia (alison oliver), in particular, briefly offers opportunity for real interest and intrigue - but the film eschews these in favour of a far more well-worn and unchallenging path.as a consequence, the second half of the film - which is written to be rich in twists, reveals and shocks - becomes bland, predictable and - frankly - boring.there are strong performances throughout the film - rosamund pike, as felix's mother, is particularly engaging and amusing, and attempts admirably to carry much of the second half of the film. jacob elordi, though slightly unconvincing as a british aristocrat, looks nevertheless to have a bright future ahead of him. richard e. grant, as felix's father, is good value as well, even if his character is a little one-dimensional.and there are interesting characters who are never properly explored. pamela (carey mulligan) is a guest at saltburn who has overstayed her welcome, but is discarded as swiftly as she is introduced. farleigh (archie madekwe) is oliver's rival for felix's attention and funding, and provides a character that is well-drawn, well-performed and interesting, but again disappears from view in the latter stages of the film. this is particularly disappointing as archie madekwe does a great job of balancing his character's contradictions: intellectual but belligerent, confident but desperate, charming but hostile.the final result has some strong moments and some good performances, but ultimately fails to develop into a worthy film. at 2 hours and 7 minutes in length, it feels at least half an hour too long, and i confess it was ultimately a relief to finally be able to leave the cinema."

","greetings again from the darkness. emerald fennell won an oscar for her original screenplay of her dark and divisive debut feature film, promising young woman (2020). she's back as writer-director of her second feature film, and it's every bit as dark, and even more scathing in its takedown of the rich and entitled. we are also treated to yet another awkwardly disturbed character for the growing resume of barry keoghan.oliver quick (keoghan) is a newly arrived student of the class of 2006 at oxford, and it's clear from the first moment that he doesn't really fit in, whether it's his clothes, not smoking, his uneasiness with his tutor, or his social ineptness. he becomes transfixed on the bmoc, felix catton (jacob elordi, fresh off his turn as elvis in priscilla). felix is tall, handsome, charming, and rich. life comes easy for him, and students are drawn to him - both male and female. he's a modern-day aristocrat, and one day oliver helps him out of a jam. this leads to a bonding, or more like worlds colliding. the first act is devoted to the development of this unexpected friendship, and leads to felix inviting oliver to spend the summer at his family estate ... saltburn.saltburn is nothing short of a magnificent castle. felix's eccentric family includes farleigh (archie madekwe, gran turismo), an adopted ""cousin"" fellow oxfor student who sees all but would never blow this gig; venetia (alison oliver), the total mess of a daughter and sister; poor dear pamela (carey mulligan), the total mess of a houseguest who has overstayed her welcome; sir james catton (richard e grant), the childlike father; and espeth catton (rosamund pike), the former model drama queen passive-aggressive mother. it's a motley crew that puts 'the royal tenenbaums' to shame for entitlement.as the summer progresses, we see oliver in action as he weasels his way into the good graces of some, while creating leverage over others. his non-descript looks, quiet demeanor, and background story lead some to protect him at the same time others distrust him. as viewers, it's obvious to us that something isn't right with oliver, yet director fennell and keoghan's performance keeps us hopeful that things won't become too skewed. those hopes are dashed once we see keoghan's first bathtub scene (and subsequent disturbing moments), and fennell serves up multiple references to his mouth in letting us know it's not to be trusted.the third act goes full dark in a deliciously wicked manner with fennell and oscar winning cinematographer linus sandgren (la la land) creating an old world style within a contemporary world. the film is perfectly cast with elordi quite magnetic as felix, the not-so-obscure object of oliver's desire. madekwe is spot on as the turf-protecting farleigh, and grant and pike make the perfectly mismatched couple of privilege. alison oliver delivers the film's best scene with her bathtub monologue, while keoghan nails the creepy oliver (in line with his roles in the banshees of inisherin, the killing of a sacred deer, and the batman. he has become the go-to psychopath. he even combines humor and horror for his happy naked castle dance in this film that has the talented mr ripley (1999) as its most obvious comparison. ms. fennell strikes another blow against the entitled elite, although we do wish she hadn't spelled out everything to end the film ... a bit of mystique would have worked.opening in theaters on november 22, 2023."

my rating 9/10
in selected cinemas nowsaltburn is the latest movie from the brilliant creative writer, director , producer and actress emerald fennell since her 2020 triumphant movie essay on vengeance promising young woman which starred her friend carey mulligan.carey mulligan only plays a cameo role in saltburn but what a brilliant cameo role it is of poor dear pamela the unwanted dysfunctional house guest.carey mulligan in an interview with margo robbie a co producer of saltburn said that the role emerald fennell originally offered her was not the one she ended up playing. on reading the script carey mulligan said she decided that she wanted to play poor dear pamela and emerald agreed to her request .i'm only assuming the other role offered to her was that of lady elspeth catton played in the movie to perfection by oscar nominee rosamund pike.this movie in fact has four oscar nominees in the cast richard e. grant, barry keoghan, carey mulligan and rosamund pike.it's no wonder to me that emerald fennell it's creator has received numerous accolades, including an academy award, two british academy film awards, one screen actors guild award, and nominations for three primetime emmy awards and three golden globe awards.one reviewer described this movie as a promising young man takes a seedy turn as it follows a young university student who becomes infatuated with his aristocratic schoolmate and his wealthy but eccentric family.my only regret with this movie is the fact that emerald fennell chose the 1.33:1 aspect ratio , her reason being that it gives the impression of ""peeping in.""
the magnificent cinematography by linus sandgren in my opinion deserves the full anamorphic 2.39:1 widescreen aspect.i call this movie an art house black comedy thriller if i had to describe it in a few words i think i would say it's brideshead revisited with the style of peter greenaway the avant- garde director of famous 1980's movies like the draughtsman's contract , drowning by numbers and the cook, the thief, his wife & her lover .this wonderful movie for me was a complete surprise and is now in my top 5 films of 2023 . it may not the be finest of the year but certainly the most original and entertaining in my opinion.not everyone will share my view but i adore clever screenplays about the psychology and obsessional aspects of the human mind especially when tinged with black humour.i couldn't help thinking of evelyn waugh's brideshead revisited while watching saltburn so after seeing the movie i wasn't surprised to read that emerald fennell recommended jacob elordi the brisbane born handsome actor read brideshead revisited to prepare for this important role in his career .in complete contrast jacob will be playing elvis presley in the forthcoming movie pricilla based on the early relationship of pricilla beaulieu and elvis .in saltburn jacob elordi plays the pivotal character of everyone's affection felix catton the son and heir of sir james catton played with delicious detachment by richard e grant and elspeth catton perfectly cast with the glamorous rosamund pike .rosamund pike has never looked as glamorous in a movie her gowns and all the costumes designed by sophie canale who was assistant costume designer on bridgerton are outstanding especially in the spectacular fancy dress masquerade birthday party scene in honour of the family interloper oliver quick also played to perfection by the academy award nominated irish supporting actor barry keoghan in the banshees of inisherin barry keoghan.barry keoghan's character oliver quick is the cuckoo in this nest of privilege , an intelligent young man from a middle class family studying at oxford not because of family wealth but on a scholarship .his character appears benign at first but gradually develops into a complex and devilishly ambitious assault on the upper class family whose hospitality and wealth turns his summer of love into a quest of betrayal.the movie begins with oliver's narrative explaining his obsessional affection for the charismatic felix catton whose life ,family and popularity starkly contrasts oliver's nerdy dullness . oliver through a set of careful manoeuvres manages to enter the world of felix catton and his aristocratic eccentric family.similar to brideshead felix invites oliver to spend the summer at his family's ancestral home saltbush where he is welcomed by the glamorous matriarch elspeth .no spoilers everyone should experience this amazing movie with fresh eyes preferably on a cinema screen as it may look very boxy on a television screen.as mentioned the sets and location shooting are stunning and feature the historic cobbled radcliffe square in oxford and its walled surroundings and colleges.the stately home that emerald fennell chose as saltburn is drayton house in northamptonshire and has never been used for filming before and may never be used again
i haven't mentioned many of the brilliant ensemble cast but the two standouts for me were archie madekwe as the young border at saltburn farleigh start who sees through oliver quick and becomes an object of jealousy.also the beautiful but troubled daughter of the household annabelle played by sadie soverall all the performances including the supercilious scene stealing butler played by paul rhys are wonderful.i'd love to spend a day in emerald fennels mind the characters that inhabit it in the stories she creates in killing eve ,promising young woman and now saltburn i find fascinating."

","saltburn is a story about oliver, portrayed by barry keoghan(love him, who doesn't? i've seen killing of a sacred deer at least 10 times).his infatuation with felix catton, which starts at oxford, quickly spirals into an obsession, leading to some morally ambiguous, if not outright disturbing, choices. what starts as a seemingly innocent attraction, soon morphs into something dark and uncontrollable.what struck me most about saltburn is its clever use of greek mythology as a narrative tool. the parallels drawn between oliver's actions and the story of theseus and the minotaur add a rich layer of symbolism. this mythological reference isn't just a backdrop; it's integral to understanding oliver's character and his journey.the film also delves into the themes of social class and the dichotomy between public persona and private reality. in an age where social media often dictates how we present ourselves to the world, 'saltburn' offers a critical, if not cynical, view of this duality. oliver's character becomes a vessel for exploring these themes, making us question the authenticity of those around us.director emerald fennell doesn't shy away from making bold choices in 'saltburn,' particularly in how the story unfolds. some may find the film's progression and its eventual climax a bit jarring, but i believe it adds to the film's uniqueness. the narrative isn't straightforward, and it's this complexity that makes 'saltburn' stand out.the performances in the film are noteworthy. barry keoghan delivers a nuanced portrayal of oliver, balancing vulnerability with an underlying sense of menace. the supporting cast, including jacob elordi and rosamund pike, also contribute significantly to the film's overall impact. i've been skeptical of them, but i was impressed.in conclusion, saltburn is a thought-provoking film that challenges conventional storytelling. it's a blend of mythology and modernity, a narrative that forces us to confront the darker aspects of desire and ambition. while it may not be everyone's cup of tea (i was grossed out by two scenes, you know the ones), for those who appreciate a film that makes you think and re-evaluate, saltburn is definitely worth a watch. i've been skeptical of them, but i was impressed."

","it doesn't take long to realist that there is nothing particularly original in the plot of this movie. more or less from the outset it promises to be a more debauched, british version of the talented mr ripley, and ultimately it never strays too far from that tag.having thus tempered expectations, there is enough in the first hour or so of this film to offer some encouragement that the film could at least be watchable.our protagonist oliver (barry keoghan) is a scholarship boy at oxford. initially ostracised from the in-crowd by his lack of wealth or social grace, he works his way into the orbit of the charming, dashing and rich felix (jacob elordi), and is ultimately invited to the titular family home. there he is introduced to the bizarre world of the british aristocracy and the idiosyncratic characters that populate it.having established this fish-out-of-water narrative, and despite the sterling efforts of its cast, the plot then begins to drift. we are offered glimpses of what might have been - the relationship between oliver and felix's sister venetia (alison oliver), in particular, briefly offers opportunity for real interest and intrigue - but the film eschews these in favour of a far more well-worn and unchallenging path.as a consequence, the second half of the film - which is written to be rich in twists, reveals and shocks - becomes bland, predictable and - frankly - boring.there are strong performances throughout the film - rosamund pike, as felix's mother, is particularly engaging and amusing, and attempts admirably to carry much of the second half of the film. jacob elordi, though slightly unconvincing as a british aristocrat, looks nevertheless to have a bright future ahead of him. richard e. grant, as felix's father, is good value as well, even if his character is a little one-dimensional.and there are interesting characters who are never properly explored. pamela (carey mulligan) is a guest at saltburn who has overstayed her welcome, but is discarded as swiftly as she is introduced. farleigh (archie madekwe) is oliver's rival for felix's attention and funding, and provides a character that is well-drawn, well-performed and interesting, but again disappears from view in the latter stages of the film. this is particularly disappointing as archie madekwe does a great job of balancing his character's contradictions: intellectual but belligerent, confident but desperate, charming but hostile.the final result has some strong moments and some good performances, but ultimately fails to develop into a worthy film. at 2 hours and 7 minutes in length, it feels at least half an hour too long, and i confess it was ultimately a relief to finally be able to leave the cinema."

","greetings again from the darkness. emerald fennell won an oscar for her original screenplay of her dark and divisive debut feature film, promising young woman (2020). she's back as writer-director of her second feature film, and it's every bit as dark, and even more scathing in its takedown of the rich and entitled. we are also treated to yet another awkwardly disturbed character for the growing resume of barry keoghan.oliver quick (keoghan) is a newly arrived student of the class of 2006 at oxford, and it's clear from the first moment that he doesn't really fit in, whether it's his clothes, not smoking, his uneasiness with his tutor, or his social ineptness. he becomes transfixed on the bmoc, felix catton (jacob elordi, fresh off his turn as elvis in priscilla). felix is tall, handsome, charming, and rich. life comes easy for him, and students are drawn to him - both male and female. he's a modern-day aristocrat, and one day oliver helps him out of a jam. this leads to a bonding, or more like worlds colliding. the first act is devoted to the development of this unexpected friendship, and leads to felix inviting oliver to spend the summer at his family estate ... saltburn.saltburn is nothing short of a magnificent castle. felix's eccentric family includes farleigh (archie madekwe, gran turismo), an adopted ""cousin"" fellow oxfor student who sees all but would never blow this gig; venetia (alison oliver), the total mess of a daughter and sister; poor dear pamela (carey mulligan), the total mess of a houseguest who has overstayed her welcome; sir james catton (richard e grant), the childlike father; and espeth catton (rosamund pike), the former model drama queen passive-aggressive mother. it's a motley crew that puts 'the royal tenenbaums' to shame for entitlement.as the summer progresses, we see oliver in action as he weasels his way into the good graces of some, while creating leverage over others. his non-descript looks, quiet demeanor, and background story lead some to protect him at the same time others distrust him. as viewers, it's obvious to us that something isn't right with oliver, yet director fennell and keoghan's performance keeps us hopeful that things won't become too skewed. those hopes are dashed once we see keoghan's first bathtub scene (and subsequent disturbing moments), and fennell serves up multiple references to his mouth in letting us know it's not to be trusted.the third act goes full dark in a deliciously wicked manner with fennell and oscar winning cinematographer linus sandgren (la la land) creating an old world style within a contemporary world. the film is perfectly cast with elordi quite magnetic as felix, the not-so-obscure object of oliver's desire. madekwe is spot on as the turf-protecting farleigh, and grant and pike make the perfectly mismatched couple of privilege. alison oliver delivers the film's best scene with her bathtub monologue, while keoghan nails the creepy oliver (in line with his roles in the banshees of inisherin, the killing of a sacred deer, and the batman. he has become the go-to psychopath. he even combines humor and horror for his happy naked castle dance in this film that has the talented mr ripley (1999) as its most obvious comparison. ms. fennell strikes another blow against the entitled elite, although we do wish she hadn't spelled out everything to end the film ... a bit of mystique would have worked.opening in theaters on november 22, 2023."

my rating 9/10
in selected cinemas nowsaltburn is the latest movie from the brilliant creative writer, director , producer and actress emerald fennell since her 2020 triumphant movie essay on vengeance promising young woman which starred her friend carey mulligan.carey mulligan only plays a cameo role in saltburn but what a brilliant cameo role it is of poor dear pamela the unwanted dysfunctional house guest.carey mulligan in an interview with margo robbie a co producer of saltburn said that the role emerald fennell originally offered her was not the one she ended up playing. on reading the script carey mulligan said she decided that she wanted to play poor dear pamela and emerald agreed to her request .i'm only assuming the other role offered to her was that of lady elspeth catton played in the movie to perfection by oscar nominee rosamund pike.this movie in fact has four oscar nominees in the cast richard e. grant, barry keoghan, carey mulligan and rosamund pike.it's no wonder to me that emerald fennell it's creator has received numerous accolades, including an academy award, two british academy film awards, one screen actors guild award, and nominations for three primetime emmy awards and three golden globe awards.one reviewer described this movie as a promising young man takes a seedy turn as it follows a young university student who becomes infatuated with his aristocratic schoolmate and his wealthy but eccentric family.my only regret with this movie is the fact that emerald fennell chose the 1.33:1 aspect ratio , her reason being that it gives the impression of ""peeping in.""
the magnificent cinematography by linus sandgren in my opinion deserves the full anamorphic 2.39:1 widescreen aspect.i call this movie an art house black comedy thriller if i had to describe it in a few words i think i would say it's brideshead revisited with the style of peter greenaway the avant- garde director of famous 1980's movies like the draughtsman's contract , drowning by numbers and the cook, the thief, his wife & her lover .this wonderful movie for me was a complete surprise and is now in my top 5 films of 2023 . it may not the be finest of the year but certainly the most original and entertaining in my opinion.not everyone will share my view but i adore clever screenplays about the psychology and obsessional aspects of the human mind especially when tinged with black humour.i couldn't help thinking of evelyn waugh's brideshead revisited while watching saltburn so after seeing the movie i wasn't surprised to read that emerald fennell recommended jacob elordi the brisbane born handsome actor read brideshead revisited to prepare for this important role in his career .in complete contrast jacob will be playing elvis presley in the forthcoming movie pricilla based on the early relationship of pricilla beaulieu and elvis .in saltburn jacob elordi plays the pivotal character of everyone's affection felix catton the son and heir of sir james catton played with delicious detachment by richard e grant and elspeth catton perfectly cast with the glamorous rosamund pike .rosamund pike has never looked as glamorous in a movie her gowns and all the costumes designed by sophie canale who was assistant costume designer on bridgerton are outstanding especially in the spectacular fancy dress masquerade birthday party scene in honour of the family interloper oliver quick also played to perfection by the academy award nominated irish supporting actor barry keoghan in the banshees of inisherin barry keoghan.barry keoghan's character oliver quick is the cuckoo in this nest of privilege , an intelligent young man from a middle class family studying at oxford not because of family wealth but on a scholarship .his character appears benign at first but gradually develops into a complex and devilishly ambitious assault on the upper class family whose hospitality and wealth turns his summer of love into a quest of betrayal.the movie begins with oliver's narrative explaining his obsessional affection for the charismatic felix catton whose life ,family and popularity starkly contrasts oliver's nerdy dullness . oliver through a set of careful manoeuvres manages to enter the world of felix catton and his aristocratic eccentric family.similar to brideshead felix invites oliver to spend the summer at his family's ancestral home saltbush where he is welcomed by the glamorous matriarch elspeth .no spoilers everyone should experience this amazing movie with fresh eyes preferably on a cinema screen as it may look very boxy on a television screen.as mentioned the sets and location shooting are stunning and feature the historic cobbled radcliffe square in oxford and its walled surroundings and colleges.the stately home that emerald fennell chose as saltburn is drayton house in northamptonshire and has never been used for filming before and may never be used again
i haven't mentioned many of the brilliant ensemble cast but the two standouts for me were archie madekwe as the young border at saltburn farleigh start who sees through oliver quick and becomes an object of jealousy.also the beautiful but troubled daughter of the household annabelle played by sadie soverall all the performances including the supercilious scene stealing butler played by paul rhys are wonderful.i'd love to spend a day in emerald fennels mind the characters that inhabit it in the stories she creates in killing eve ,promising young woman and now saltburn i find fascinating."

","saltburn is a story about oliver, portrayed by barry keoghan(love him, who doesn't? i've seen killing of a sacred deer at least 10 times).his infatuation with felix catton, which starts at oxford, quickly spirals into an obsession, leading to some morally ambiguous, if not outright disturbing, choices. what starts as a seemingly innocent attraction, soon morphs into something dark and uncontrollable.what struck me most about saltburn is its clever use of greek mythology as a narrative tool. the parallels drawn between oliver's actions and the story of theseus and the minotaur add a rich layer of symbolism. this mythological reference isn't just a backdrop; it's integral to understanding oliver's character and his journey.the film also delves into the themes of social class and the dichotomy between public persona and private reality. in an age where social media often dictates how we present ourselves to the world, 'saltburn' offers a critical, if not cynical, view of this duality. oliver's character becomes a vessel for exploring these themes, making us question the authenticity of those around us.director emerald fennell doesn't shy away from making bold choices in 'saltburn,' particularly in how the story unfolds. some may find the film's progression and its eventual climax a bit jarring, but i believe it adds to the film's uniqueness. the narrative isn't straightforward, and it's this complexity that makes 'saltburn' stand out.the performances in the film are noteworthy. barry keoghan delivers a nuanced portrayal of oliver, balancing vulnerability with an underlying sense of menace. the supporting cast, including jacob elordi and rosamund pike, also contribute significantly to the film's overall impact. i've been skeptical of them, but i was impressed.in conclusion, saltburn is a thought-provoking film that challenges conventional storytelling. it's a blend of mythology and modernity, a narrative that forces us to confront the darker aspects of desire and ambition. while it may not be everyone's cup of tea (i was grossed out by two scenes, you know the ones), for those who appreciate a film that makes you think and re-evaluate, saltburn is definitely worth a watch. i've been skeptical of them, but i was impressed."

","it doesn't take long to realist that there is nothing particularly original in the plot of this movie. more or less from the outset it promises to be a more debauched, british version of the talented mr ripley, and ultimately it never strays too far from that tag.having thus tempered expectations, there is enough in the first hour or so of this film to offer some encouragement that the film could at least be watchable.our protagonist oliver (barry keoghan) is a scholarship boy at oxford. initially ostracised from the in-crowd by his lack of wealth or social grace, he works his way into the orbit of the charming, dashing and rich felix (jacob elordi), and is ultimately invited to the titular family home. there he is introduced to the bizarre world of the british aristocracy and the idiosyncratic characters that populate it.having established this fish-out-of-water narrative, and despite the sterling efforts of its cast, the plot then begins to drift. we are offered glimpses of what might have been - the relationship between oliver and felix's sister venetia (alison oliver), in particular, briefly offers opportunity for real interest and intrigue - but the film eschews these in favour of a far more well-worn and unchallenging path.as a consequence, the second half of the film - which is written to be rich in twists, reveals and shocks - becomes bland, predictable and - frankly - boring.there are strong performances throughout the film - rosamund pike, as felix's mother, is particularly engaging and amusing, and attempts admirably to carry much of the second half of the film. jacob elordi, though slightly unconvincing as a british aristocrat, looks nevertheless to have a bright future ahead of him. richard e. grant, as felix's father, is good value as well, even if his character is a little one-dimensional.and there are interesting characters who are never properly explored. pamela (carey mulligan) is a guest at saltburn who has overstayed her welcome, but is discarded as swiftly as she is introduced. farleigh (archie madekwe) is oliver's rival for felix's attention and funding, and provides a character that is well-drawn, well-performed and interesting, but again disappears from view in the latter stages of the film. this is particularly disappointing as archie madekwe does a great job of balancing his character's contradictions: intellectual but belligerent, confident but desperate, charming but hostile.the final result has some strong moments and some good performances, but ultimately fails to develop into a worthy film. at 2 hours and 7 minutes in length, it feels at least half an hour too long, and i confess it was ultimately a relief to finally be able to leave the cinema."

","greetings again from the darkness. emerald fennell won an oscar for her original screenplay of her dark and divisive debut feature film, promising young woman (2020). she's back as writer-director of her second feature film, and it's every bit as dark, and even more scathing in its takedown of the rich and entitled. we are also treated to yet another awkwardly disturbed character for the growing resume of barry keoghan.oliver quick (keoghan) is a newly arrived student of the class of 2006 at oxford, and it's clear from the first moment that he doesn't really fit in, whether it's his clothes, not smoking, his uneasiness with his tutor, or his social ineptness. he becomes transfixed on the bmoc, felix catton (jacob elordi, fresh off his turn as elvis in priscilla). felix is tall, handsome, charming, and rich. life comes easy for him, and students are drawn to him - both male and female. he's a modern-day aristocrat, and one day oliver helps him out of a jam. this leads to a bonding, or more like worlds colliding. the first act is devoted to the development of this unexpected friendship, and leads to felix inviting oliver to spend the summer at his family estate ... saltburn.saltburn is nothing short of a magnificent castle. felix's eccentric family includes farleigh (archie madekwe, gran turismo), an adopted ""cousin"" fellow oxfor student who sees all but would never blow this gig; venetia (alison oliver), the total mess of a daughter and sister; poor dear pamela (carey mulligan), the total mess of a houseguest who has overstayed her welcome; sir james catton (richard e grant), the childlike father; and espeth catton (rosamund pike), the former model drama queen passive-aggressive mother. it's a motley crew that puts 'the royal tenenbaums' to shame for entitlement.as the summer progresses, we see oliver in action as he weasels his way into the good graces of some, while creating leverage over others. his non-descript looks, quiet demeanor, and background story lead some to protect him at the same time others distrust him. as viewers, it's obvious to us that something isn't right with oliver, yet director fennell and keoghan's performance keeps us hopeful that things won't become too skewed. those hopes are dashed once we see keoghan's first bathtub scene (and subsequent disturbing moments), and fennell serves up multiple references to his mouth in letting us know it's not to be trusted.the third act goes full dark in a deliciously wicked manner with fennell and oscar winning cinematographer linus sandgren (la la land) creating an old world style within a contemporary world. the film is perfectly cast with elordi quite magnetic as felix, the not-so-obscure object of oliver's desire. madekwe is spot on as the turf-protecting farleigh, and grant and pike make the perfectly mismatched couple of privilege. alison oliver delivers the film's best scene with her bathtub monologue, while keoghan nails the creepy oliver (in line with his roles in the banshees of inisherin, the killing of a sacred deer, and the batman. he has become the go-to psychopath. he even combines humor and horror for his happy naked castle dance in this film that has the talented mr ripley (1999) as its most obvious comparison. ms. fennell strikes another blow against the entitled elite, although we do wish she hadn't spelled out everything to end the film ... a bit of mystique would have worked.opening in theaters on november 22, 2023."

""interstellar"" occurs in the late 21st century, after things have waxed really wretched. bad enough that farmers can grow only corn. blight has destroyed wheat and okra. public opinion about nasa has curdled. history textbooks have been rewritten. everybody believes nasa faked the apollo moon landings to bankrupt the soviet union. a former nasa test pilot, cooper (matthew mcconaughey of ""mud""), has turned to farming and reaped rewards where many others have failed. although his wife died from a brain cyst that an mri could have detected had an mri had been available, cooper perseveres as a farmer and a father of two children, his fifteen-year old son tom (timoth√©e chalamet of ""worse friends""), and his precious ten-year old daughter murph (mackenzie foy of ""the conjuring"") who adore him. cooper and his kids live with his father-in-law, donald (john lithgow of ""terms of endearment""), and they contend with tumultuous dust storms on a daily basis. these dust storms recall the depression era drought and dust storms of that prompted millions to flee from the plains states. dust gets into everything, and donald wages a never-ending war to keep everything clean. meanwhile, books have been toppling randomly from murph's bedroom bookcase. she suspects a ghost is responsible, but nothing ghoulish like ""paranormal activity."" naturally, cooper dismisses the presence of ghosts. one day after a particularly turbulent dust storm, father and daughter examine the way the books have fallen out of the shelves, translate it into code, and come up with coordinates that lead them to a classified norad facility. a monolithic robot named tars confronts them. later, murph and cooper find themselves sitting around a table talking with high-ranking nasa officials. one of them is professor brand (michael caine of ""batman begins""), and brand confides in cooper that the world is living on borrowed time. moreover, he tells him about the 'lazarus' project. nasa has dispatched manned missions to other parts of the galaxy to find a new home for mankind. he convinces cooper to sign on as a pilot for one last launch that will take his daughter, biologist amelia (oscar winning actress anne hathaway of ""les mis√©rables); physicist romilly (david gyasi); geographer doyle (wes bentley of ""the hunger games""); and two robots tars (voice of bill irwin) and case (voice of josh stewart) deep into space to a recently discovered wormhole which will enable them to explore new worlds. predictably, murph isn't happy about her father's departure. during their flight to the wormhole, cooper and company lose contact with earth, but professor brand can still transmit messages. gradually, however, things take a turn for the worst. the final quarter hour of ""interstellar"" will absolutely boggle your mind. cooper goes where no man has gone before in a desperate bid to save mankind! ""interstellar"" is a serious sci-fi movie. the computer-generated visual effects are nothing short of dazzling, and nolan orchestrates the flight sequences so we don't hear any sounds in the vacuum of outer space. the different spacecraft and the endurance mother ship look as authentic as the outfits that our heroes wear. the strange but new worlds that they encounter during their search to locate a new earth are breathtaking. one world consists of an eternal sea with towering waves that loom like mountain ranges, while another is as stark and icy as it is inhospitable. the theme of deception runs throughout ""interstellar."" the faked apollo moon landing and dr. brand's mind-blowing revelation are a few surprises that will maintain your interest throughout ""interstellar."" nolan generates several suspenseful set-pieces that will keep you poised on the edge of your seat. matt damon has a startling cameo as another astronaut who has succumbed to effects of isolation. clocking in at 169 minutes, ""interstellar"" amounts to an unforgettable epic with intense white-knuckled suspense, top-notch performances, and a terrific ending."

","i was extremely lucky to get the chance to see this film upon its first day release, before entering the cinema, my expectations were already high, after all, this was a film from the cinematic genius who brought us the likes of 'inception' and 'the dark knight', to summarise the following review in a single sentence: i left the cinema in extreme awe from the visual masterpiece i had just viewed. a film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the nolan brothers. whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: a space odyssey' and 'apollo 13', 'interstellar' is unique in its own way. whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful christopher nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen. a sheer brilliant feat of cinema."
"1514","interstellar","feastmode",2019-07-01,9," greatest movie of all time
","i rate this movie 11/10 to signify it's greatness. perfection. mind-blowing. a workout for your brain. i want to have debates about it. i want to write research papers on it. amazingly unbelievably awesome. this is the kind of movie that opens up your mind. lots of amazing scenes with epic music. a killer story told flawlessly. perfect directing by the best ever. great cast with great acting. a deep psychological aspect explored for numerous characters.the most renowned theoretical physicist who is an expert on cosmology was brought on to keep the science honest, as well as a retired astronaut who's been to space five times. one of the rare movies that is better the second, and even the third time watching. the only movie i have ever liked the most the fourth time. i keep picking up on more things and a better overall understanding. so many parts are extremely moving and powerful. it does an awesome job of making you feel what the characters are feeling.edit on tenth viewing: this movie destroys me every time. numerous tears every time. and i don't just mean at the obvious emotional parts. there are so many moments where i am in complete awe at the beauty of the filmmaking i'm experiencing, to the point of tears. the way the story all comes together and the ""epiphany moment"" is so perfect that it brings me to tears.when watching movies, i sometimes think, ""this is the best thing i've ever seen"" or ""this is the coolest thing i've ever seen."" i know it's hyperbole and i've said it many times, usually at one or maybe two scenes in a movie. during interstellar, i feel this way for about 40% of this three hour movie. every time i watch, it re-emphasizes that it is cleary my favorite movie of all-time. and that musical score alone gives me goosebumps for so much of the movie. hans is the goat. nolan is the goat.(10 viewings, 12/2/2016, 2/26/2020, 1/11/2022, 8/9/2023)spoilersi was randomly thinking about interstellar, haven't watched it in at least 6 months. i thought about one hypothetical that intrigued me: what if the tesseract is such that it can only be placed inside an already collapsed black hole. if plan b was what ""originally"" happened and dr. brand survived, future people figured it out, and they want to save those they left behind on earth, they need to find a love-link between someone who goes into a black hole and someone on earth smart enough to be able to solve the gravity problem = cooper and murph. doctor brand knows this because she knows cooper loves murph, knows he sacrifices himself by falling into the black hole, knows murph grows up to be her dad's understudy, so she has the future people (eventually, after her death) put the machine in the same black hole that cooper falls into, thereby making the entire plan work. intriguing. will need to confirm on next viewing... after watching again, i like this as a viable theory, but it conflicts with another theory i had about the ""original"" mission being completed without cooper.lots of awesome concepts that made me think, like murphy's law not applying close to a black hole, human survival instincts and it encompassing your children, love being a quantifiable scientific force, the black hole and time relativity. the robots are cool and original. really awesome visuals of things i've wondered about but never really imagined. i liked the depiction of the 5 dimensions in 3d in the daughter's room. the way everything connected is very awesome. the different planets are so interesting with ice clouds and giant tidal waves. the endings are perfect.something i noticed that i didn't realize the first time is the reason his son became dark and a little crazy. he was still a good person, even after experiencing the death of his son, jesse. however, once his wife convinced him to let go of the idea that his father was coming back, he gave up on everything in life and became a horrible husband, father and brother.the relationship between coop and murph is the best relationship i can remember in any movie i've seen. the primary underlying theme in the movie is the love between a father and his daughter being able to transcend space and time, which is the key to her getting the information she needs to save the world.from interstellar group chat discussion:-or the other theory i had was that originally plan b was the one that worked and a colony survived and eventually was able to do what they did and wanted to save all the people that ended up dying on earth and try to make plan a work-so she finds out that plan a was a sham. that the professor had already solved the equation years ago before she even met him. that he knew even with solving the equation that they couldn't figure out how to get the people off earth. she found out they knew they were never coming back and they were going to let everyone on earth to die. so every day since she was 10 that she has been hoping her father would come home was a lie. she should have never been hoping. her entire 20 years that she dedicated her life to working on this was a complete waste. that should break a person. murph is a beast.-the love between them was the only reason the world ended up being saved. it's the only reason she kept trying that hard after all those years. it's the only reason she went back to her house in her room. it's the only reason she saw the watch again. it's the only reason she figured out that the watch twitching was her dad sending the data.12/2/16: i watched interstellar again wow. i found a flaw in my theory that in the original timeline they used plan b without cooper, and then when they became advanced they went back to try to get cooper so they could save the people that died on earth. the problem is, how would they have gotten past the problems with re-docking onto the spinning blown up ship after mann backstabbed humanity. but it actually makes perfect sense because in the original timeline cooper would not have convinced them to go to mann's planet, brand would have convinced them to go to edmund's planet which was the right one. in that ""original"" timeline, love still saved humanity since it helped her choose the right planet."

","(this is both a review of the film, and an assertion of christopher nolan's filmmaking style)there have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film (the visual effects, the acting, the music), but say how it's not christopher nolan's best directed film. this is where i personally would have to disagree. before i get into it, though, i'll talk about interstellar a bit.interstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. to compare said film to '2001: a space odyssey' isn't just a disservice, but unnecessary. the films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. also, stanley kubrick's vision of arthur c. clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. with interstellar, mr. nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of nolan's films). but it's so much more than that too. there are no words to express the epic journey nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. the acting is top-notch, especially mcconaughey, who gives (i would say) his most emotional performance yet. but the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was david gyasi as romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the endurance, their spacecraft. the musical score from hans zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). the visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. to see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by kip thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. but even everything else, from the alien planets to the endurance, the visuals always look real. then, there's the writing. i would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film.now, about mr. nolan. don't just look at nolan, but look at his films. some say inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it's the dark knight, or memento. but honestly, every single film christopher nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of nolan. following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put mr. nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to nolan, after seeing memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. then, right after, he directed the remake of the norwegian thriller, insomnia. this, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. then, we were given his take on the batman universe, starting with batman begins, the origin masterpiece. then, there's the prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. the dark knight, his bold masterpiece; inception, his complex masterpiece, and the dark knight rises, his flawed masterpiece. now, we have interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece.this is just my looking at nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny interstellar is one hell of a journey. he certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. i can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as interstellar."

"1518","interstellar","tardieu-felix",2014-11-01,10," interstellar : an open-hearted & mastered human odyssey
","the film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. this life is not enough for cooper, brilliantly played by mcconaughey who gave body and soul to this character. but all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of christopher nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by hans zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of hoyte van hoytema, and the sincerity of nolan's directing. he manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with hans zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. thus we are transported into the same cockpit that cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. all of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to endurance taking off. this simple editing decision allows nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film.you don't necessarily have to understand it immediately : the film will raise questions in you, such as : what is it to be a human being, is there some physical limitations to our humanity, how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge, is there other dimensions that we can not access to, and above all: what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? is this bond only intelligible, or is it also tangible ? all these questions resonate in harmony in nolan's interstellar. interstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. i use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by hans zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. we are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded. i have seen all the talent of the director that i knew he was outside the norm, but whom i did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. because this is it: interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. it's much more than that. this is much more than just a sci-fi movie. it is unlike any of his previous films. some hoped to see interstellar as christopher nolan's best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. and indeed, this is not the best film of christopher nolan. because in a way, it is his first film. i'm not saying that interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. but to me interstellar is the first film of a new stage in nolan's filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. interstellar is the proof that nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of the dark knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured.now, in this third act of the film, it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. but he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love, that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. but nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. from my point of view, only solaris by steven soderbergh (2002), unfortunately neglected by the audience, was able to accomplish that. interstellar is based on a premise which is the following : from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time, we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species, as we always leave a part of ourselves ""behind"" us. in other words, i could say that this is a human story, and even if we go as far as we want to, if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of, we will only get closer to them. because the separation, and thus the distance and time, can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. because it is going to the end of the world, when we reach the end of ourselves, that we reach the singularity of the ""black hole beyond the horizon"" * : it is our humanity. no, i wasn't been able to find any bad flaws in the film. not one, and i'm still looking. after all, interstellar is like gravity, ""all it takes is a little push !

"1520","interstellar","horst_in_translation",2014-12-25,10," maybe the most spectacular movie of 2014 and one of the best
","to this day , many people still talk a lot about christopher nolan's ""batman""-trilogy, but here is his newest work: ""interstellar"". he gets help from michael caine and anne hathaway again and a couple more familiar faces. one year after cuar√≥n with gravity, he discovers the endless widths of space as well. the difference, however is that a large part of his movie, including the first 40 minutes or so completely, plays down on planet earth. however, it is also about survival in space, including two people instead of one though. or you could probably say the whole human race and not one individual fate.this is like our generation's ""armageddon"", only that it is much better and much more edge-of-the-seat. the lead character is played by matthew mcconaughey, whose career is still on a massive high after numerous critically lauded performances and an academy award win. ""interstellar"" is much more than sci-fi though. i personally found the film was at its best when it touched more the emotional relationships of the characters. the water planet sequence was incredibly well done. and right afterward, when cooper (mcconaughey) sees how his beloved family has aged and become parents, it is truly moving as well. i had a lump in my throat just like i did when he meets his very old daughter at the end of the movie. the inclusions with the old people telling about the past seem a bit odd at first, but make sense towards the end as we find out who is speaking there really.then, i also had a love-hate relationship with the matt damon parts. i found it pretty boring to be honest initially, but when we found out about his true intentions, it quickly turns into one of the best parts of the film. nicely done. when caine's character mentioned him with high praise early on, i felt there could be something fishy (like with pixar's up) there and yes it was. the ending of the movie with hathaway's character completely alone out there made me think maybe there will be a sequel. saving private... ehh i mean dr. brand. who knows? the time during which the whole film plays is also interesting. somehow, the nasa lost a lot of their reputation and the moon landing is called fake in american school books. it is some point in the future. that much we know. david oyelowo plays a small role here as one of the teachers. he has ""selma"" in the race for an academy award nomination this year.the ending of the film was not among the best scenes in my opinion, but i still liked it. the whole ghost explanation about cooper being actually the one giving the signs was pretty exciting. the effects are brilliant of course, but that does not really need be mentioned for nolan movies. a given. hans zimmer did a good soundtrack and there is also some comic relief coming from mcconaughey's charm (if you like that) and some droll robot creatures. anyway, i found the film interesting enough that i found it a bit sad they did not get to visit the third planet (with hathaway's character's lover), only the water planet and the ice planet. i'd have loved to see that. however, maybe that could be a nice inclusion for a sequel as well. the movie never dragged despite coming pretty close to the three-hour mark. it could have run for another hour and i probably would not have been bored. there really was hardly anything wrong with it. affleck's character did not do too much for me. he wasn't particularly well-acted and the character felt just included as a simple man who quickly gave up on his dad in order to show the contrast compared to chastain's character: the ambitious loving smart daughter with a true connection to cooper. john lithgow plays a small role too and is fun to watch as always.this is one of the movies i really recommend to watch, preferably on the big screen due to its sensational visual aspects. it's also good for a rewatch i believe, also to evaluate the characters' actions, especially caine's for example. and the story of course. i believe, after one viewing, i am still far away from having understood everything that was going on, especially the scientific aspects. that however, does not hurt the viewing experience at all thanks to the film's great acting and emotional impact. if you are interested in space, you really have to see this too. it has distant planets, wormholes, black holes, spaceships and a lot more. let me finish this review with two little snippets: first, the actress who played murph as a child was the same that played renesmee in the last two twilight movies and, secondly, that fittingly hathaway's character was called amelia like the aviation pioneer amelia earhart. that can't be coincidence, can it? especially with her last shot."

"1523","interstellar","bob-the-movie-man",2014-11-12,10," going brilliantly (but very loudly) into the dark
","wowser! this christopher nolan film was presaged with such marketing hype that i went in with pretty low and cynical expectations. but i was frankly blown away with it.just about everyone raves about christopher nolan's work, and you look back at his filmography and it makes for a pretty impressive resume: from memento via the (rather over-hyped imho) dark knight batman series-reboot through to inception, one of my favourite films of all time. for me, interstellar is right up there with inception for thought-provoking, visually spectacular and truly epic cinema.we start in familiar 'day after tomorrow"" territory, with mankind having in some way ‚Äì not entirely explained ‚Äì messed up the planet. as i understood it (and the film probably does require multiple watches with ‚Äì see comments below ‚Äì subtitles=on) the rather clever premise is that the world's food supplies are being progressively destroyed by a vindictive 'blight'. this delivers the double whammy of destroying mankind's provisions but also, by massive reproduction of the organism, progressively depleting the earth's oxygen. for some reason ‚Äì again, which i didn't get on first viewing ‚Äì this is accompanied by massive dust storms. it is a morbid bet as to what is going to get the mid-west population first: starvation, lung disease or suffocation. matthew mcconnaughey plays the widowed cooper, an ex-nasa drop out turned farmer given the opportunity by mission-leader professor brand (an excellent michael caine) to pilot a nasa mission. the goal is to punch through a mysterious wormhole in space where they suspect, through previous work, that a new home for mankind could be found.the first part of the film is set on and around cooper's farm, setting in place one of the emotional wrenches at the heart of the film: that cooper in volunteering for the mission and having to leave behind his elderly father (john lithgow, again superb) and young children murph (aged 10) and tom (aged 15) whilst recognising that danger for him comes not just from the inherent risks involved but from the theory of relativity that could change everything, time-wise, for when he returns.cooper is supported on the mission by a team of scientists including brand's daughter played by a love-struck anne hathaway, who again shows she can act.to say any more would spoil what is a voyage of visual and mental discovery. (however, i would add that it is good to see that the character that plays my namesake dr mann (in a surprise cameo) is equally good looking! lol).in terms of plus points, where do i start? the visuals are utterly stunning. whilst reminiscent in places of kubrick's ""stargate"" from 2001, the similarity is only passing. the film adds a majesty and scale to space that surpasses wonder. elsewhere there are some interesting visual effects: this might have just been me of course, but after the dramatic launch there was something about the camera moves during the first scenes of weightlessness that made me feel genuinely nauseous.equally stunning is hans zimmer's score which is epic and (in places) very very loud. the film certainly doesn't ""go quietly into the night""! when matching the noise of the score/choir to the sound effects in the launch sequence the combination is ear-bleedingly effective. this must be a strong contender for the soundtrack oscar for 2014. one quibble, again 2001 related, is that zimmer uses the last chord of also sprach zarathustra in the score sufficiently often that one hopes richard strauss's estate receives some royalties! the acting is top notch: i've already mentioned caine and lithgow, but mcconnaughey, hathaway and jessica chastain are all great. a particular shout-out should go to mackenzie foy as the young murph, who is magnetically charismatic and just brilliant in the role.above all, nolan's direction is exquisite. the film has a slow build on earth (which adds to the lengthy running time) but defines the characters and primes the plot perfectly. and some of the editing cuts ‚Äì again, cooper's farm departure/launch sequence overlay is a great example ‚Äì are superb in building the mood and the tension.i've decided that i am an extremely tough reviewer and for me a 10 star film is a rarity indeed. where i could have knocked off a star was in some of the dialogue on the soundtrack, which was pretty inaudible in places: mcconnaughey in particular with his general mumbling and strong southern accent is indecipherable in places. i look forward to the dvd subtitles. and one of the character's dying words ‚Äì delivering a key plot point in the film ‚Äì was completely lost to me (but thankfully later restated). whilst the expansive plot is highly ambitious, the end of the film, playing fast and loose with physics i fear, requires a gravity-defying suspension of belief (although i guess the same could equally be said of 2001: a space odyssey).however, the film has stayed so firmly lodged in my mind for 24 hours i will make a rare exception to my rating 'rule'. overall, this is a top-notch sci-fi film. and a final word: people¬Ö this is a must see on the big screen!

","in an age when movie and tv franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (i'm looking at you, disney), i don't think anyone was expecting much from puss in boots: the last wish - certainly not i.after the first 5 minutes, i knew this was something special.firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from arkane and enter the spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. the 2d elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.the music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).the dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling i think i've ever seen. in a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. the cast do a great job of selling them too. goldi and the bears come out with brilliant british-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.and then there's the wolf. this character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. his style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, i'm serious).at a time when disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - dreamworks have taken on the mantle.it made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. you might think i'm overselling it, but hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.there are those that say that hollywood is done - i know i do. but dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

","likes:pacing
-very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.adorable characters/feel
-new characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-the feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-has that element of shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.the animation
-it's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy dreamworks does so well.-the design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-the world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that i certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-and it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than disney for the blend of real and cartoons.the voice acting:
-many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that snl like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. he own the horner character and brought some of the best lines.-wagner moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the big-bad wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-pugh is okay, not my favorite role as goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. it does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-banderas takes boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the spanish stereotype. and yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.the references/jokes
-the stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of shrek.-it's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-the fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-it feels like the first two shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. again, refreshing that they were able to step back.the designs changes to an extent
-creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-like into the spiderverse? good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that puss does.-not overused, which is very good for me.the action at times
-shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-this movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-the ending fight shows the potential of what dreamworks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes i've seen this year.the heart
-lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-the movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-there are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. that's hard to do in many things.-i love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-have not felt this way since shrek 2.dislikes:the darkness
-it's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.predictable
-the lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-the movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.too many antagonists
-one of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-they do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.the comedy is still tapered
-it's starting to go back to shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made shrek, shrek.-they took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.the animation changes at times
-the animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-the comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.the action still not complete
--shrek and shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-this movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-the stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-they sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-often was shorter than i wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.the verdict
i must say, puss in boots: the last wish was a much better film than when i walked in. perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. it evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. and it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. this film is indeed a solid return to the world and i had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. however, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance i was looking for. the movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with puss in boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. and the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the shrek that we saw in the first two movies. still, i do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

","puss and boots: the last wish was a true 'feel good' movie. the plot was well thought out and transitioned flawlessly from the last puss and boots film. what made this different from the previous movie is the mature theme and sentiments that made the film enjoyable and illuminating for all ages. the story progression was smooth and did not make the movie feel too short or too long. the story's theme (life is too short, so we must value what we have) flows through several different angles and characters throughout the story. the theme is not lost during the movie and is carried by the protagonist's emotions and personal growth. the characters in this movie helped express the theme and made the film more enjoyable. puss was the perfect protagonist, and his personal growth in the movie showed the audience that it is never too late for a fresh start, especially given that his character did not transition from the last film to the beginning of this one. kitty and pedrito's contrasting personalities and feelings allow two perspectives to get through to puss and show him what it means to be a family. goldy and the three bears added an extra obstacle for 'team friendship' but highlighted the theme through their growth. death was a great character because he was simply doing his job and was the character that indirectly pushed puss to become a better person and respected him for it. jack horner was an excellent antagonist because he was indeed a villain. instead of a character that was hurt by society or had good intentions deep down, this character was a pure monster. it was refreshing to have a villain that everyone could get behind disliking. the dialogue in this movie was powerful. each sentence helped tell the story, and it did not feel like there were any filler lines. the comic relief was natural, and the emotional conversations were deep. the imagery and background in the film were well articulated and detailed. each setting aligned with the active story and flowed with the transitions. the background music of the story was also fitting; it added an extra layer for the viewer and did not distract them from the story. this movie gave hope for the future of animated movies in america."

","after losing his eighth life to a bell falling on top of him, puss in boots is down to his last life. an encounter from a vicious bounty hunter with a frightening presence destroys his confidence and for the first time, he feels fear. after escaping by the skin of his teeth, he decides he is no longer worthy of the name puss in boots and begins life as an adopted cat. he learns about the dark forest where someone can make a wish on the wishing star. with this in mind, the crafty feline returns to adventure to get his lives back.a little late to review this movie, but i still caught it in theaters. i knew from the trailer that this would be a cool movie. at first, i was wondering why dreamworks is creating another puss in boots movie. it feels weird to make a sequel to a spin-off that came out over a decade ago. as someone who has not watched the original puss in boots, i do not think you need to watch the original to get what is going on here aside from maybe puss' relationship with kitty softpaws. with that said, let me tell you how good this movie is!puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animated films. first of all, the animation looks absolutely stunning. the movie has probably the best animation from a cgi film i have ever seen. not only do the movement and expressions look smooth and crisp, the cinematography and imagery looks amazing and memorable too. there are many awesome shots in this film such as a shot of puss staring in the eyes of death. these shots strengthen the emotional moments and even some of the funny moments as well. every shot in this movie looks awesome. the animation really shows its fluidity in the action scenes. this movie has better action than 90% percent of the live-action blockbusters out there. the set pieces are so dynamic and entertaining that there is not a boring moment in the film. the opening set piece sets the tone for the entire movie and from that point forward, i knew i was in for a ride. the soundtrack is awesome too from the catchy score to the fun opening song for puss in boots.fantastic visuals aside, the story is memorable too. this movie pushes its pg rating. there is blood, cursing and dark themes that may frighten younger viewers. the story is about how puss is reacting to the idea that he is on deaths door. if he dies one more time, he will be gone forever. this is a movie where we see one of the coolest and most confident characters in animation lose his confidence. with that, he has a character arc that gives him depths and flaws that are relatable so even when he does something kind of selfish, you can still sympathize with his motivations. this movie has a lot of stylish action and funny jokes, but the scenes revolving around the wolf ramp up the dark tone of the movie. it never loses its sense of humor and this is one funny movie. i love the snarky dialogue, perrito gets one scene with goldilocks and the three bears that steals the show comedy wise. this movie has the perfect mix of comedy, action, drama and emotional moments to make it stand out.in addition to a great story, the cast of characters are memorable too. puss is at his best. he is the same awesome and adorable character from shrek, but he is given a lot of vulnerability here. he starts out as this arrogant, but powerful guy who can take down giants, but when he sees that death is coming for him, you can see how it shakes him to the core. his friends kitty softpaws and especially perrito are great characters too. perrito seems like the guy that would annoy everyone, but he is a great support character who is hilarious and just plain adorable. he is also surprisingly aware of emotions. there is one scene with him and puss that warmed my heart.as for the antagonists, the wolf is one of my favorite antagonists in an animated film. he has a badass voice, he completely changes the tone of the movie and he wipes out puss' bravado entirely and reduces him to a frightened cat. he is also a great fighter, but it is his presence, voice, dialogue and whistle that make him truly memorable. kids might have nightmares because of him. goldilocks and the three bears are fun anti-villains that have a sweet bond with each other. then there is the gluttonous scumbag jack horner. this is the character the writers decided to just make as hilariously hatable and disgusting as possible. they make no attempt to give this guy any sympathetic trait and i love it. we need more outright terrible people in new animated films. he is a funny villain with how unapologetic he is towards his minions, but you will be actively rooting for this character's demise.every single character in this film is memorable to a degree. it helps that the voice acting in this movie is excellent with antonio banderas as puss, salma hayek as kitty, harvey gull√©n as perrito, john mulaney as jack horner and especially wagner moura as the wolf. moura might have one of the best voices for a villain in animation i have seen in a while. each person brings their character to life in this movie. i can see any main character here being someone's favorite in the movie. that is how you know that you have a great cast.there is not a dull moment in this movie. puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animation and more. i did not expect a movie like this to be that great, but when i saw the trailers with the gorgeous animation, i knew this movie was going to be a ride. i did not expect it to become one of my favorite films of 2022, but it definitely. i really hope it wins best animated feature at the academy awards this year. dreamworks deserves this one. check it out as soon as you can."

","this is the best animated feature since into the spider-verse, and probably better than toy story 4 and soul. i don't find many movies rewatchable nowadays and this is one of the few. not only is it a visual masterpiece (huge credit to the animators, well done!) but from a critical standpoint is has extremely well done characters, an engaging and relatable story, and takes very bold actions that will leave animation-lovers stunned for years to come. spoilers would be ruining an experience that you simply must witness for yourself, so what are you waiting for? believe the hype, go watch it if you haven't already! 9.5/10 but imma round up.edit: i've given it a year and came back to it and it's just even better the second viewing. in my opinion this is dreamwork's greatest movie (especially if you take away the first 5 minutes), better than kung fu panda, how to train your dragon, even prince of egypt. also the only dreamworks movie that i think deserves a 10/10. it's one thing to make an actually good and compelling story but to be also very entertaining and engaging for everyone is another feat. the user ratings and critics ratings are way too low. most criticisms of the movie are, imo, flawed, non-existent or biased. i sincerely cannot recommend this movie enough."

","it may seem like puss in boots: the last wish pointless ridiculous film on the surface ..... but there is a lot to like about this animated dreamworks film; the movie delivers on several levels making it worth your time seeking out . i am praising the overall aesthetic. the animation is more advanced, the movie looked like it was a fairy tale painting. takes advantage of modern cg technologies lovingly paired with more traditional 2d techniques. in the opening, the film uses more hand-drawn techniques like your yesteryear cartoons . and as it progresses the technique harnessed new advancements in cg technology to reintroduce this fairy tale world in new and refreshing way.....it is quite the spectacle to witness and in 3d to boot !!! not the same old cg. in the animation, they actually took off motion blur so that it frames stutters . i have actually never seen animation technique like this before ! really made this fantastical hybrid.puss in boots: the last wish mashed up a spaghetti western with a fairy tale, so you get those beautiful western compositions and staging opportunities, but then you get these fantastical locations born out of your imagination.puss in boots discovers that his passion for adventure has taken its toll: he has burnt through eight of his nine lives. puss sets out on an epic journey to find the mythical last wish and restore his nine lives.and the movie is all brought to life with a cast full of oscar nominated and winner actors; it makes all the sense in the world when you've got an entire universe populated by iconic fairy tale characters like goldilocks (florence pugh), the three bears (olivia colman, ray winstone, and samson kayo), the big bad wolf (wagner moura), little jack horner (john mulaney), and even puss himself (antonio banderas).this is a ""must-see"" for all. there are so many takeaways. this movie kept me wanting more. it was great to see all the fairy tale characters in play wanting something they already possessed, needing to appreciate the moment--learning to be mindful of what we already have around us everyday. it's equal parts exciting and hilarious as well as earnest. puss in boots: the last wish mixes stunning animation with a poignant, surprisingly mature story . 8/10."

","i've been a fan of puss in boots ever since i saw the first movie in 2011. i love his charm, his wit, and his badassery. so when i heard that there was going to be a new puss in boots movie, i was beyond excited.ah, puss in boots, the last wish movie - a nostalgic journey that whisked me back to a time when my biggest concern was deciding between chocolate or vanilla ice cream. with its witty charm and swashbuckling feline hero, this film felt like a warm hug from my childhood, complete with a sprinkle of grown-up humor.as the screen came alive with the mischievous adventures of puss, i couldn't help but chuckle at his charismatic swagger. that confident strut and those pleading eyes - i must admit, i almost believed i could pull off wearing a hat like that without looking utterly ridiculous. almost.the tale unfolds with all the whimsy of a fairy tale, complete with a daring quest and an oh-so-noble motive - the last wish. now, i've never met a talking cat in real life (although i've had my suspicions about mr. whiskers next door), but puss's banter with his furry and cute companions had me in stitches. it's like the avengers, but with furballs. genius.puss in boots: the last wish did not disappoint. it was everything i wanted it to be and more. the animation was beautiful, the story was engaging, and the humor was on point. but what really made the movie for me was the heart.this movie is a love letter to puss in boots and his fans. it's a story about a cat who is coming to terms with his mortality. it's a story about friendship, love, and finding your purpose in life. and it's a story that will stay with me long after i've seen it.i'm not going to lie, there were a few moments when i teared up. but it was the good kind of tears. the kind of tears that come from being deeply moved by a story.if you're a fan of puss in boots, then you need to see this movie. it's a must-see for any fan of animation, adventure, or heartwarming stories."

","don't get me wrong, i liked the first movie a lot but i had issues with it. humpty dumpty is one of the most confusing and dumb villains ever in dreamworks history, and kitty didn't felt like her own character and she was rendered a bit pathetically. however fortunately the last wish doesn't have those problems. kitty actually felt like her own character with her own choices and the villain is a huge improvement over humpty dumpty. instead of the confusing story we got, death was excellent. he was absolutely terrifying and a fitting antagonist for puss for about death. but the overall villain was jack horner and just like any other good villains, he was actively threatening, and a good story to back it up. the first had great action but this had a great great action if you know what i mean. only the kung fu panda and spider verse movies beat this in action. i particularly liked the climactic final duel between puss and death, it's such a creative battle and colorful as well. speaking of colorful, it was a wise move to adopt to the comic style animation instead of rest of the shrek franchise with realistic 3d animation. and one more praise are the messages, the first barely had a message to begin with because the message was bogged down by the confusing plot involving humpty. however the message was well and clearly told during this film because of family trope. goldie ended up appreciating her current family and puss himself ended up appreciating his friends and kitty instead of glory and fame which is a pretty strong message.however i just have one complaint. wasn't kitty and puss madly in love at the end of the first movie? i felt like they did it all over again and puss's arch in the first 30mins was a bit confusing which holds it back from becoming my 2nd favorite dreamworks film and a 10/10

"1575","interstellar","oktay_tuna",2023-01-12,9," a strange comparison(with breaking bad) and then some
","in the shrek movies, puss in boots was a very likable character. i think it is safe to assume that most of the people who love shrek (specifically shrek 2) also enjoy seeing puss in boots. it is enjoyable to watch him, doesn't interfere much with the themes of movies but has funny scenes and great action. as i was thinking of these things, i realized something. he is just like saul goodman from breaking bad. saul goodman is a great character in breaking bad. he is great in scenes he is in and is so fun to watch but he isn't much of a character. then better call saul came and saul goodman (jimmy mcgill) became as complex as (if not more) walter. first puss in boots movie wasn't like that for puss. it was more of the same in shrek movies. this movie delivers the character puss in boots desperately needed and then some. his arc in this movie is amazing and in a perfect world, the script of this movie would get an adapted screenplay nomination at the oscars this year (considering the fact that the competition in the adapted screenplay category is nonexistent).death is an amazing villain. having shorter screen time than most characters makes him an even better character. again another comparison to better call saul, death is like lalo salamanca. lalo also doesn't have a big screen time in the six seasons of the show, but he is easily one of the most memorable characters. death is always there, back in the audience's mind, and just when you forget that he exists, he returns. his whistle, his charisma... brilliant!puss and kitty's storyline and conflict are very complex when you remember that this is an animated movie mostly targeted at kids. the themes of legacy, the meaning of life, and the fear of attachment are very refreshing to see in an animated movie again. the addition of perrito creates a great contrast between him and puss and i would even go further to say that it can even spark some philosophical discussions about which way to live is better for you. legacy or living a life where you are comfortable with your family.i loved the additions of the three bears and goldilocks. their storyline was also fairly interesting to see progress but its pacing could have been better, which makes them the weakest links of the film which is a d**n good weak link if you ask me. the character of jack horner. he has very funny moments and is very interesting to see a villain who is truly deeply villainous with no point of return in an animated movie. the conscience bug thing was also interesting to see unfold.the animation and action scenes are superb. especially the ones with death. death is so good that i can't believe it. there are many jokes that land, songs that are fun and most importantly the movie structurally works. it just works. with this many characters, with this many plotlines, with this many detours, you might think that it is impossible to tie this in a great package. but they do. when this movie is at its worst, it is decent but when it is at its best it is one of the best-animated movies, ever.where did this movie come from? i would have wanted to be a kid when i first watched this movie. i would have been scared but i would have loved it. then i would have watched it again, sometime. and then again. it would have created nostalgia and at my age today when i would have looked back i would have said, ""it is not the best-animated movie ever, but it is my favorite animated movie ever."" because it would have been. what more can i say?"

","do you like anime, because i do, and by god is this the most anime-like american animated movie i've seen. the way it does smooth action and atmosphere as well as intricate character moments reminds me a lot of series i've watched with a lot more detail and time. not only do the messages and themes resonate, but the portrayals are done surprisingly well of things like anxiety, fear of death, etc etc. i know that animated children's movies can execute these well, but this takes it to another level for me while having exhilarating anime-like fight scenes. they're on another level for something out of dreamworks, compare it to the shrek scene where he's fighting some of farquad's goons and it's like night and day. anyways, give this a watch, one of the best animated films in a fat minute."

"1591","interstellar","oktay_tuna",2023-01-12,9," a strange comparison(with breaking bad) and then some
","in the shrek movies, puss in boots was a very likable character. i think it is safe to assume that most of the people who love shrek (specifically shrek 2) also enjoy seeing puss in boots. it is enjoyable to watch him, doesn't interfere much with the themes of movies but has funny scenes and great action. as i was thinking of these things, i realized something. he is just like saul goodman from breaking bad. saul goodman is a great character in breaking bad. he is great in scenes he is in and is so fun to watch but he isn't much of a character. then better call saul came and saul goodman (jimmy mcgill) became as complex as (if not more) walter. first puss in boots movie wasn't like that for puss. it was more of the same in shrek movies. this movie delivers the character puss in boots desperately needed and then some. his arc in this movie is amazing and in a perfect world, the script of this movie would get an adapted screenplay nomination at the oscars this year (considering the fact that the competition in the adapted screenplay category is nonexistent).death is an amazing villain. having shorter screen time than most characters makes him an even better character. again another comparison to better call saul, death is like lalo salamanca. lalo also doesn't have a big screen time in the six seasons of the show, but he is easily one of the most memorable characters. death is always there, back in the audience's mind, and just when you forget that he exists, he returns. his whistle, his charisma... brilliant!puss and kitty's storyline and conflict are very complex when you remember that this is an animated movie mostly targeted at kids. the themes of legacy, the meaning of life, and the fear of attachment are very refreshing to see in an animated movie again. the addition of perrito creates a great contrast between him and puss and i would even go further to say that it can even spark some philosophical discussions about which way to live is better for you. legacy or living a life where you are comfortable with your family.i loved the additions of the three bears and goldilocks. their storyline was also fairly interesting to see progress but its pacing could have been better, which makes them the weakest links of the film which is a d**n good weak link if you ask me. the character of jack horner. he has very funny moments and is very interesting to see a villain who is truly deeply villainous with no point of return in an animated movie. the conscience bug thing was also interesting to see unfold.the animation and action scenes are superb. especially the ones with death. death is so good that i can't believe it. there are many jokes that land, songs that are fun and most importantly the movie structurally works. it just works. with this many characters, with this many plotlines, with this many detours, you might think that it is impossible to tie this in a great package. but they do. when this movie is at its worst, it is decent but when it is at its best it is one of the best-animated movies, ever.where did this movie come from? i would have wanted to be a kid when i first watched this movie. i would have been scared but i would have loved it. then i would have watched it again, sometime. and then again. it would have created nostalgia and at my age today when i would have looked back i would have said, ""it is not the best-animated movie ever, but it is my favorite animated movie ever."" because it would have been. what more can i say?"
"1592","interstellar","parksiet",2022-12-28,7," a cute family friendly adventure!
","""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a fun adventure in the ""shrek"" universe! i gotta admit i have not seen the original film, and don't cherish the ""shrek"" films as much as many do... so i went into this with mild expectations. and honestly, i had a good time; it was cute! do i think it was as good as many other reviewers have suggested? no. but it was enjoyable, lighthearted fun that is perfect for families with kids! the voice cast was awesome, especially john mulaney and florence pugh as the villains, jack horner and goldilocks respectively. and of course antonio banderas as puss in boots is iconic as ever!the animation here was gorgeous too, honestly it was one of my favourite parts. i love that major studio animated movies are finally starting to take more risks with their animation style, moving away from the typical 3d cgi realism. you gotta respect ""spider-man: into the spider-verse"" for starting this trend and showing that different styles can work! i loved that this had a more watercolor, storybook illustration look to it, it really worked for the story and was employed in such creative ways! i would love to see the ""shrek"" movies take this on, but alas they seem to have established their own look. this movie just looked so cool, so distinct in its own style, it really felt like i was watching a story in a fairy tale world.now, of course i have to admit i didn't love this movie. something about it felt off to me, i couldn't seem to see where the acclaim was coming from. sure, it was fun, it was cute, and i enjoyed myself while watching, but i never felt like i truly connected with the film. the opening scene felt a little jumbled to me, rapidly going from a musical sequence, to comedy for kids, to an action scene and i wished it would've let me settle into the story a bit first. i get this is a movie primarily for kids, but with most animation they tend to make parts enjoyable for the parents and older audiences as well. i don't really feel that here - they tried with the themes and the deeper storyline - but it never actually worked in my eyes. everything felt very kid-focused, which isn't a bad thing, it just meant i wasn't the core audience and so it makes sense why i wouldn't enjoy it as much. i have to say, the kids in my theatre seemed to be having a blast! i'm sure this is a great movie for families with children, it just wasn't as good as i was told it would be.i think the movie tried to do a bit of what pixar is known for, the whole ""trying to be deep"" thing. the movie involves puss in boots coming to terms with death, and it seemed to be somewhat shallow, it never truly dove into this aspect of the story. instead, the storyline is very linear and somewhat dull where it is just about the characters traveling to their destination and the villains sometimes catching up and then combat ensuing. and the physical goal literally being the spiritual goal just makes the inevitable plot point of ""maybe i don't need the thing i wanted all long and it's the friends i made along the way that count"" seem all the more predictable. even puss' relationship with the side characters is unchallenging. although he is deeply flawed, his companions never seem to care about that and forgive him all the time. the chemistry of the characters was just nowhere as endearing as in ""shrek"". still the adventure was quite fun, i just didn't think the themes clicked as it felt like they were trying to be deep in a way that is not as organic and surprising as a film like pixar's ""up"", ""finding nemo"" or even dreamworks' ""how to train your dragon"".perhaps i am being too harsh, i feel like this review is sounding more negative than anything. i really did have fun with it, and overall would give it a thumbs up, it's an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half. the animation was really cool, the voice cast was great, and man i loved the little nods to the ""shrek"" movies even if i was never a huge fan of those. if nothing else, this movie did make me really hopeful for another ""shrek"" film. i do enjoy this fairy tale world and the creative animation they used to tell the story!"
"1593","interstellar","jp_91",2022-12-12,7," a visual delight. a script that could have given more.
","""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a film whose animation is excellent, full of colorful and detailed scenes, but its script becomes tired in some scenes and even predictable, although its positive message on issues of personal relationships stands out. the characters are fun, highlighting goldilocks and the three bears. antonio banderas and salma hayek manage to entertain by lending their voices to the protagonists. puss in boots is a fun character but his story lacks more irreverence like in ""shrek"". the soundtrack perfectly recreates the essence of a fairy tale. ""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a visual delight with a passable script that could have been better."
"1594","interstellar","adamlennard",2023-05-09,10," how is it this good?
","so the first movie was ok, nothing spectacular but not bad by any means, one of those you won't go out your way to watch but if it's on you'd sit and watch it. so i was quite shocked that it was getting a sequel further shocked when so many people saying how good it is, so i took my four year old and my god this is disney pixar levels of good. how is puss in boots 2 honestly one of all the time great animated films? well i'll try to explain first the animation style is beautiful and perfect for this movie and because it's a different style from the shrek universe movies it stands out. then there's the characters all the main cast are wonderfully voiced (especially the wolf) and their stories are all told so well and developed. big jack horner is one of the best movie villains for years no tragic backstory, no sympathetic qualities just evil for evils sake and loves being evil. i must also mention the wolf, this character may give younger kids nightmares but as they get older they'll appreciate how awesome he is. the music is beautiful too. i could go forever, i love this movie it is a masterpiece and a travesty it never won best animated movie at the oscar's but still i feel it's good enough love that it won't matter. the last thing i can see is a great movie makes you feel lots of different emotions and this does that ,you can laughing one minute to going aww, to crying to craping yourself in terror. this film is a masterpiece."
"1595","interstellar","deltawdunn",2023-07-17,9," one of dreamworks' best
","movies like this are the perfect counter to those who hold kid's movies to low standards. while this movie does have style, it's not particularly unique in terms of its story. it's a rather standard journey with most of what you'd expect from an animated kids movie. comedy relief sidekick, expected love interest, an irredeemable villain, etc etc... however, it does all of these so well that the predictability didn't matter. i know puss won't die, but the scenes with death are still tense because i buy puss' fear. after a while i knew goldie's wish would be for a human family and that by the end she'd learn to appreciate her bear family, but that doesn't change that it's very well done. big jack horner is cartoonishly evil, but he's the funniest character, and there are other characters who are actually well-developed so it didn't really matter. it has good action, a great opener, and some cool editing choices. aside from the great visual style and the fact that it expertly juggles three villain factions, this movie is pretty basic, but still great.it's not perfect though. in particular, i think the section at mama luna's was pretty meh. honestly, i don't think i'd care if the movie wasn't so tight, but the character mama luna herself wasn't really relevant and considering the prevalence of these scenes in the trailer, i think this could've been studio interference. maybe not though, one shouldn't assume that anything bad in a movie is due to execs.regardless, this is a great movie, easily top 5 in dreamwork's catalog, and probably higher. it's either an 8/10 or 9/10, can't really decide."
"1596","interstellar","jph-65157",2023-08-02,9," beautifully animated, cool action sequences, funny new/returning characters, and full of important life lessons.
","when i first heard about the last wish, and saw some of the trailers, i thought it was going to be a bit goofy and not as good as the first one (though seeing puss say ""no hablo ingl√©s"" to get out of talking to that dog made me chuckle) and the stylized animation looked cheap and kind of hurt my eyes and i wasn't that interested. however, once i saw a few clips of it, i thought it looked rather interesting and decided to give a shot.after i finally watched it, i have to admit it was actually very good and comparable to the first puss in boots movie and in some cases, even better. the premise was interesting, the animation actually was pretty good, the stylized animation actually worked out pretty well (especially for the action sequences), full of new characters that were funny and cool, and had some important life lessons for everyone to remember and use in their everyday lives.so i liked the premise because puss using up eight of his nine lives and trying to get to the last wish to gain them back while also battling a bunch of other characters who want the wish sets up a cool and interesting story that'll keep you hooked to see who actually gets the wish. you can kind of guess what will happen in the end, but you still want to see what happens regardless.the animation was pretty beautiful as well because although they did not use the realistic animation of the shrek movies or the first puss in boots movie, having it stylized and more comic book-like works out well here as it makes the movie look more vivid and gives you a more fairy tale vibe. plus, there were more details they could add to the characters and the scenery as well. also, as much it kind of looked cheap, the stylized animation worked out well for some of the action scenes and made them look pretty cool and graphic and added more suspense to the fight scenes between the good guys and the bad guys.the characters were also pretty cool as well. puss (once again voiced by antonio banderas) is just as funny, cool, and energetic as he always was in the previous films, kitty softpaws (once again voiced by selma hayek) adds some great humor and banter with puss once again in his mission, and the new characters were quite interesting too. perrito, the little dog (voiced by harvey guill√©n), is pretty funny and although plays the typical annoying sidekick, his role works out pretty well here as he helps puss and kitty. goldilocks and the three bears (voiced by florence pugh, olivia colman, ray winstone, and samson kayo) add some funny humor as well and their banter with each other is quite hilarious as well. big jack horner, one of the villains (voiced by john mulaney), is certainly devious and sarcastic, and his dark humor is ironically quite funny at times (i mean, if he's voiced by mulaney, then obviously it's going to be funny, due to his rather deadpan delivery of his lines).then there's the wolf (voiced by wagner moura), who serves as the other villain in this, but way darker and more sinister than jack horner. specifically, he is really the grim reaper who is after puss for him cheating death eight times and wants to take his last life as punishment, even though puss is still alive. now, when i say this character is dark, he--is--dark! like from his red eyes to his hooded figure to his low, slow, creepy sounding voice to his spine chilling/goosebump inducing whistling to his only intention of claiming puss' last life, this is a dark villain done right and probably one of the best ones in any dreamworks movie in a long time. heck, i was surprised the directors and writers made the wolf as dark as they did as it would certainly freak out some kids, and even some adults as well. at the same time though, i'll give them credit for really stepping it up here and making a very interesting and intimidating villain, as well as not making him a surprise villain too and you knew he was a villain from the beginning (the surprise villain trope has been used too much lately and it was nice to have the obvious villain trope come back once again in my opinion). i would say if you have kids, viewer discretion is advised for the wolf's scenes, but it's just a few scenes and it's not constantly.now for the themes, they were definitely important ones that i believe we all should consider in our daily lives. i won't try to spoil anything with them, but the themes presented in the last wish involve being happy with the family you grew up with even if they're not your biological family, being around people (and animals) that you can trust, and also, accepting that death is an inevitable thing, but that means living life to the fullest and enjoying every moment of it and do not waste it. again, not trying to spoil too much, but they were presented really well in the last wish that will definitely grasp your attention and might even get you thinking about how things are going with your life and might make you consider making some better changes for yourself.alright, so i know that was a lot to say here, but i just wanted to go over everything that i liked about the last wish. i know it's been out for a while now, but for those who haven't seen it yet, i'd recommend giving it a chance because it's definitely one of the better animated movies that have come out in recent years and it's one that i'm sure you'll love instantly once you watch it. it does have its serious moments, but it has a good blend of that and humor and some touching moments that hit you in the feels. lastly, if you're a fan of puss in boots, then seeing him in action once again will definitely satisfy your movie going needs.so if you have netflix, apple tv, or any other streaming service puss in boots: the last wish is on, go watch it!!!"

","it was a refreshing experience, this beautiful story tells you the importance of the one life we all got. after a long time, i watched a dreamworks animated movie. well, it tried to make a new animation style, taking inspiration from 'into the spider-verse' 2d effects but also not losing their original stylized 3d style, i like it.fairy tale and say what, a fun & life moral centric story focuses on puss's story, making him take life seriously and that's interesting. but the best part of the whole movie was, the antagonist, death... i mean hat's off to death's acting, dialogues, and animation, you can count him as one of the coldest villains on your list. his whistle literally is scary, it feels good to listen but the tone isolates, as if it's a warning that death is coming to you. he is the highlight of this movie. also, i personally, like the story of the side characters, goldi and bears, or probably i liked goldi's character design and character arc.i'll recommend if you looking for something fun and life refreshing story, then definitely check this out because i bet you will be impressed by death's presence in scenes."

"1610","interstellar","oktay_tuna",2023-01-12,9," a strange comparison(with breaking bad) and then some
","in the shrek movies, puss in boots was a very likable character. i think it is safe to assume that most of the people who love shrek (specifically shrek 2) also enjoy seeing puss in boots. it is enjoyable to watch him, doesn't interfere much with the themes of movies but has funny scenes and great action. as i was thinking of these things, i realized something. he is just like saul goodman from breaking bad. saul goodman is a great character in breaking bad. he is great in scenes he is in and is so fun to watch but he isn't much of a character. then better call saul came and saul goodman (jimmy mcgill) became as complex as (if not more) walter. first puss in boots movie wasn't like that for puss. it was more of the same in shrek movies. this movie delivers the character puss in boots desperately needed and then some. his arc in this movie is amazing and in a perfect world, the script of this movie would get an adapted screenplay nomination at the oscars this year (considering the fact that the competition in the adapted screenplay category is nonexistent).death is an amazing villain. having shorter screen time than most characters makes him an even better character. again another comparison to better call saul, death is like lalo salamanca. lalo also doesn't have a big screen time in the six seasons of the show, but he is easily one of the most memorable characters. death is always there, back in the audience's mind, and just when you forget that he exists, he returns. his whistle, his charisma... brilliant!puss and kitty's storyline and conflict are very complex when you remember that this is an animated movie mostly targeted at kids. the themes of legacy, the meaning of life, and the fear of attachment are very refreshing to see in an animated movie again. the addition of perrito creates a great contrast between him and puss and i would even go further to say that it can even spark some philosophical discussions about which way to live is better for you. legacy or living a life where you are comfortable with your family.i loved the additions of the three bears and goldilocks. their storyline was also fairly interesting to see progress but its pacing could have been better, which makes them the weakest links of the film which is a d**n good weak link if you ask me. the character of jack horner. he has very funny moments and is very interesting to see a villain who is truly deeply villainous with no point of return in an animated movie. the conscience bug thing was also interesting to see unfold.the animation and action scenes are superb. especially the ones with death. death is so good that i can't believe it. there are many jokes that land, songs that are fun and most importantly the movie structurally works. it just works. with this many characters, with this many plotlines, with this many detours, you might think that it is impossible to tie this in a great package. but they do. when this movie is at its worst, it is decent but when it is at its best it is one of the best-animated movies, ever.where did this movie come from? i would have wanted to be a kid when i first watched this movie. i would have been scared but i would have loved it. then i would have watched it again, sometime. and then again. it would have created nostalgia and at my age today when i would have looked back i would have said, ""it is not the best-animated movie ever, but it is my favorite animated movie ever."" because it would have been. what more can i say?"

","""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a fun adventure in the ""shrek"" universe! i gotta admit i have not seen the original film, and don't cherish the ""shrek"" films as much as many do... so i went into this with mild expectations. and honestly, i had a good time; it was cute! do i think it was as good as many other reviewers have suggested? no. but it was enjoyable, lighthearted fun that is perfect for families with kids! the voice cast was awesome, especially john mulaney and florence pugh as the villains, jack horner and goldilocks respectively. and of course antonio banderas as puss in boots is iconic as ever!the animation here was gorgeous too, honestly it was one of my favourite parts. i love that major studio animated movies are finally starting to take more risks with their animation style, moving away from the typical 3d cgi realism. you gotta respect ""spider-man: into the spider-verse"" for starting this trend and showing that different styles can work! i loved that this had a more watercolor, storybook illustration look to it, it really worked for the story and was employed in such creative ways! i would love to see the ""shrek"" movies take this on, but alas they seem to have established their own look. this movie just looked so cool, so distinct in its own style, it really felt like i was watching a story in a fairy tale world.now, of course i have to admit i didn't love this movie. something about it felt off to me, i couldn't seem to see where the acclaim was coming from. sure, it was fun, it was cute, and i enjoyed myself while watching, but i never felt like i truly connected with the film. the opening scene felt a little jumbled to me, rapidly going from a musical sequence, to comedy for kids, to an action scene and i wished it would've let me settle into the story a bit first. i get this is a movie primarily for kids, but with most animation they tend to make parts enjoyable for the parents and older audiences as well. i don't really feel that here - they tried with the themes and the deeper storyline - but it never actually worked in my eyes. everything felt very kid-focused, which isn't a bad thing, it just meant i wasn't the core audience and so it makes sense why i wouldn't enjoy it as much. i have to say, the kids in my theatre seemed to be having a blast! i'm sure this is a great movie for families with children, it just wasn't as good as i was told it would be.i think the movie tried to do a bit of what pixar is known for, the whole ""trying to be deep"" thing. the movie involves puss in boots coming to terms with death, and it seemed to be somewhat shallow, it never truly dove into this aspect of the story. instead, the storyline is very linear and somewhat dull where it is just about the characters traveling to their destination and the villains sometimes catching up and then combat ensuing. and the physical goal literally being the spiritual goal just makes the inevitable plot point of ""maybe i don't need the thing i wanted all long and it's the friends i made along the way that count"" seem all the more predictable. even puss' relationship with the side characters is unchallenging. although he is deeply flawed, his companions never seem to care about that and forgive him all the time. the chemistry of the characters was just nowhere as endearing as in ""shrek"". still the adventure was quite fun, i just didn't think the themes clicked as it felt like they were trying to be deep in a way that is not as organic and surprising as a film like pixar's ""up"", ""finding nemo"" or even dreamworks' ""how to train your dragon"".perhaps i am being too harsh, i feel like this review is sounding more negative than anything. i really did have fun with it, and overall would give it a thumbs up, it's an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half. the animation was really cool, the voice cast was great, and man i loved the little nods to the ""shrek"" movies even if i was never a huge fan of those. if nothing else, this movie did make me really hopeful for another ""shrek"" film. i do enjoy this fairy tale world and the creative animation they used to tell the story!"
"1612","interstellar","jp_91",2022-12-12,7," a visual delight. a script that could have given more.
","""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a film whose animation is excellent, full of colorful and detailed scenes, but its script becomes tired in some scenes and even predictable, although its positive message on issues of personal relationships stands out. the characters are fun, highlighting goldilocks and the three bears. antonio banderas and salma hayek manage to entertain by lending their voices to the protagonists. puss in boots is a fun character but his story lacks more irreverence like in ""shrek"". the soundtrack perfectly recreates the essence of a fairy tale. ""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a visual delight with a passable script that could have been better."
"1613","interstellar","adamlennard",2023-05-09,10," how is it this good?
","so the first movie was ok, nothing spectacular but not bad by any means, one of those you won't go out your way to watch but if it's on you'd sit and watch it. so i was quite shocked that it was getting a sequel further shocked when so many people saying how good it is, so i took my four year old and my god this is disney pixar levels of good. how is puss in boots 2 honestly one of all the time great animated films? well i'll try to explain first the animation style is beautiful and perfect for this movie and because it's a different style from the shrek universe movies it stands out. then there's the characters all the main cast are wonderfully voiced (especially the wolf) and their stories are all told so well and developed. big jack horner is one of the best movie villains for years no tragic backstory, no sympathetic qualities just evil for evils sake and loves being evil. i must also mention the wolf, this character may give younger kids nightmares but as they get older they'll appreciate how awesome he is. the music is beautiful too. i could go forever, i love this movie it is a masterpiece and a travesty it never won best animated movie at the oscar's but still i feel it's good enough love that it won't matter. the last thing i can see is a great movie makes you feel lots of different emotions and this does that ,you can laughing one minute to going aww, to crying to craping yourself in terror. this film is a masterpiece."
"1614","interstellar","deltawdunn",2023-07-17,9," one of dreamworks' best
","movies like this are the perfect counter to those who hold kid's movies to low standards. while this movie does have style, it's not particularly unique in terms of its story. it's a rather standard journey with most of what you'd expect from an animated kids movie. comedy relief sidekick, expected love interest, an irredeemable villain, etc etc... however, it does all of these so well that the predictability didn't matter. i know puss won't die, but the scenes with death are still tense because i buy puss' fear. after a while i knew goldie's wish would be for a human family and that by the end she'd learn to appreciate her bear family, but that doesn't change that it's very well done. big jack horner is cartoonishly evil, but he's the funniest character, and there are other characters who are actually well-developed so it didn't really matter. it has good action, a great opener, and some cool editing choices. aside from the great visual style and the fact that it expertly juggles three villain factions, this movie is pretty basic, but still great.it's not perfect though. in particular, i think the section at mama luna's was pretty meh. honestly, i don't think i'd care if the movie wasn't so tight, but the character mama luna herself wasn't really relevant and considering the prevalence of these scenes in the trailer, i think this could've been studio interference. maybe not though, one shouldn't assume that anything bad in a movie is due to execs.regardless, this is a great movie, easily top 5 in dreamwork's catalog, and probably higher. it's either an 8/10 or 9/10, can't really decide."
"1615","interstellar","jph-65157",2023-08-02,9," beautifully animated, cool action sequences, funny new/returning characters, and full of important life lessons.
","when i first heard about the last wish, and saw some of the trailers, i thought it was going to be a bit goofy and not as good as the first one (though seeing puss say ""no hablo ingl√©s"" to get out of talking to that dog made me chuckle) and the stylized animation looked cheap and kind of hurt my eyes and i wasn't that interested. however, once i saw a few clips of it, i thought it looked rather interesting and decided to give a shot.after i finally watched it, i have to admit it was actually very good and comparable to the first puss in boots movie and in some cases, even better. the premise was interesting, the animation actually was pretty good, the stylized animation actually worked out pretty well (especially for the action sequences), full of new characters that were funny and cool, and had some important life lessons for everyone to remember and use in their everyday lives.so i liked the premise because puss using up eight of his nine lives and trying to get to the last wish to gain them back while also battling a bunch of other characters who want the wish sets up a cool and interesting story that'll keep you hooked to see who actually gets the wish. you can kind of guess what will happen in the end, but you still want to see what happens regardless.the animation was pretty beautiful as well because although they did not use the realistic animation of the shrek movies or the first puss in boots movie, having it stylized and more comic book-like works out well here as it makes the movie look more vivid and gives you a more fairy tale vibe. plus, there were more details they could add to the characters and the scenery as well. also, as much it kind of looked cheap, the stylized animation worked out well for some of the action scenes and made them look pretty cool and graphic and added more suspense to the fight scenes between the good guys and the bad guys.the characters were also pretty cool as well. puss (once again voiced by antonio banderas) is just as funny, cool, and energetic as he always was in the previous films, kitty softpaws (once again voiced by selma hayek) adds some great humor and banter with puss once again in his mission, and the new characters were quite interesting too. perrito, the little dog (voiced by harvey guill√©n), is pretty funny and although plays the typical annoying sidekick, his role works out pretty well here as he helps puss and kitty. goldilocks and the three bears (voiced by florence pugh, olivia colman, ray winstone, and samson kayo) add some funny humor as well and their banter with each other is quite hilarious as well. big jack horner, one of the villains (voiced by john mulaney), is certainly devious and sarcastic, and his dark humor is ironically quite funny at times (i mean, if he's voiced by mulaney, then obviously it's going to be funny, due to his rather deadpan delivery of his lines).then there's the wolf (voiced by wagner moura), who serves as the other villain in this, but way darker and more sinister than jack horner. specifically, he is really the grim reaper who is after puss for him cheating death eight times and wants to take his last life as punishment, even though puss is still alive. now, when i say this character is dark, he--is--dark! like from his red eyes to his hooded figure to his low, slow, creepy sounding voice to his spine chilling/goosebump inducing whistling to his only intention of claiming puss' last life, this is a dark villain done right and probably one of the best ones in any dreamworks movie in a long time. heck, i was surprised the directors and writers made the wolf as dark as they did as it would certainly freak out some kids, and even some adults as well. at the same time though, i'll give them credit for really stepping it up here and making a very interesting and intimidating villain, as well as not making him a surprise villain too and you knew he was a villain from the beginning (the surprise villain trope has been used too much lately and it was nice to have the obvious villain trope come back once again in my opinion). i would say if you have kids, viewer discretion is advised for the wolf's scenes, but it's just a few scenes and it's not constantly.now for the themes, they were definitely important ones that i believe we all should consider in our daily lives. i won't try to spoil anything with them, but the themes presented in the last wish involve being happy with the family you grew up with even if they're not your biological family, being around people (and animals) that you can trust, and also, accepting that death is an inevitable thing, but that means living life to the fullest and enjoying every moment of it and do not waste it. again, not trying to spoil too much, but they were presented really well in the last wish that will definitely grasp your attention and might even get you thinking about how things are going with your life and might make you consider making some better changes for yourself.alright, so i know that was a lot to say here, but i just wanted to go over everything that i liked about the last wish. i know it's been out for a while now, but for those who haven't seen it yet, i'd recommend giving it a chance because it's definitely one of the better animated movies that have come out in recent years and it's one that i'm sure you'll love instantly once you watch it. it does have its serious moments, but it has a good blend of that and humor and some touching moments that hit you in the feels. lastly, if you're a fan of puss in boots, then seeing him in action once again will definitely satisfy your movie going needs.so if you have netflix, apple tv, or any other streaming service puss in boots: the last wish is on, go watch it!!!"

","it was a refreshing experience, this beautiful story tells you the importance of the one life we all got. after a long time, i watched a dreamworks animated movie. well, it tried to make a new animation style, taking inspiration from 'into the spider-verse' 2d effects but also not losing their original stylized 3d style, i like it.fairy tale and say what, a fun & life moral centric story focuses on puss's story, making him take life seriously and that's interesting. but the best part of the whole movie was, the antagonist, death... i mean hat's off to death's acting, dialogues, and animation, you can count him as one of the coldest villains on your list. his whistle literally is scary, it feels good to listen but the tone isolates, as if it's a warning that death is coming to you. he is the highlight of this movie. also, i personally, like the story of the side characters, goldi and bears, or probably i liked goldi's character design and character arc.i'll recommend if you looking for something fun and life refreshing story, then definitely check this out because i bet you will be impressed by death's presence in scenes."

","'puss in boots: the last wish (2022)' is brilliant. teeming with energy from the moment it begins, this animated adventure is as exhilarating as it is emotionally mature. it balances its swashbuckling action, quick-witted comedy, emotional character work and surprisingly poignant musings on mortality incredibly well. there isn't a moment of the perfectly paced piece that feels out of pace. it truly is an absolute blast. it's also beautiful, with stylishly snappy animation that immediately grabs you by the collar and drags you into the colourful storybook setting. the action scenes, in particular, are a real highlight; you're sure to have a smile on your face for each and every one. except, perhaps, those involving the wolf - not because they aren't wonderful, but because they're shockingly scary. the big bad is genuinely terrifying on occasion and his introductory scene is nothing short of a masterpiece. the internal conflict he inspires in the central character is arguably what elevates the picture to another level, and the literal manifestations of this conflict are inarguably the highlights of the entire affair. the characters all have a good amount of depth to them and they're brought to life with vital voicework that never misses a beat. even the usually annoying cute sidekick is here a sincere, funny and likeable presence that adds genuine value to the narrative. there's very little not to like here. one thing that's perhaps worth mentioning is that there's one scene in which a certain character seems to have been rendered unlit, leading to a distracting sense that the shots in which they appear are literally unfinished. some of the character arcs are predictable and there are a couple of jokes that don't quite land, too. these really are very minor flaws, though. ultimately, this is a ton of fun from start to finish. it's the sort of thing that puts a smile on your face simply because of how well achieved it is. it's phenomenal."

","in the shrek movies, puss in boots was a very likable character. i think it is safe to assume that most of the people who love shrek (specifically shrek 2) also enjoy seeing puss in boots. it is enjoyable to watch him, doesn't interfere much with the themes of movies but has funny scenes and great action. as i was thinking of these things, i realized something. he is just like saul goodman from breaking bad. saul goodman is a great character in breaking bad. he is great in scenes he is in and is so fun to watch but he isn't much of a character. then better call saul came and saul goodman (jimmy mcgill) became as complex as (if not more) walter. first puss in boots movie wasn't like that for puss. it was more of the same in shrek movies. this movie delivers the character puss in boots desperately needed and then some. his arc in this movie is amazing and in a perfect world, the script of this movie would get an adapted screenplay nomination at the oscars this year (considering the fact that the competition in the adapted screenplay category is nonexistent).death is an amazing villain. having shorter screen time than most characters makes him an even better character. again another comparison to better call saul, death is like lalo salamanca. lalo also doesn't have a big screen time in the six seasons of the show, but he is easily one of the most memorable characters. death is always there, back in the audience's mind, and just when you forget that he exists, he returns. his whistle, his charisma... brilliant!puss and kitty's storyline and conflict are very complex when you remember that this is an animated movie mostly targeted at kids. the themes of legacy, the meaning of life, and the fear of attachment are very refreshing to see in an animated movie again. the addition of perrito creates a great contrast between him and puss and i would even go further to say that it can even spark some philosophical discussions about which way to live is better for you. legacy or living a life where you are comfortable with your family.i loved the additions of the three bears and goldilocks. their storyline was also fairly interesting to see progress but its pacing could have been better, which makes them the weakest links of the film which is a d**n good weak link if you ask me. the character of jack horner. he has very funny moments and is very interesting to see a villain who is truly deeply villainous with no point of return in an animated movie. the conscience bug thing was also interesting to see unfold.the animation and action scenes are superb. especially the ones with death. death is so good that i can't believe it. there are many jokes that land, songs that are fun and most importantly the movie structurally works. it just works. with this many characters, with this many plotlines, with this many detours, you might think that it is impossible to tie this in a great package. but they do. when this movie is at its worst, it is decent but when it is at its best it is one of the best-animated movies, ever.where did this movie come from? i would have wanted to be a kid when i first watched this movie. i would have been scared but i would have loved it. then i would have watched it again, sometime. and then again. it would have created nostalgia and at my age today when i would have looked back i would have said, ""it is not the best-animated movie ever, but it is my favorite animated movie ever."" because it would have been. what more can i say?"
"1629","interstellar","parksiet",2022-12-28,7," a cute family friendly adventure!
","""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a fun adventure in the ""shrek"" universe! i gotta admit i have not seen the original film, and don't cherish the ""shrek"" films as much as many do... so i went into this with mild expectations. and honestly, i had a good time; it was cute! do i think it was as good as many other reviewers have suggested? no. but it was enjoyable, lighthearted fun that is perfect for families with kids! the voice cast was awesome, especially john mulaney and florence pugh as the villains, jack horner and goldilocks respectively. and of course antonio banderas as puss in boots is iconic as ever!the animation here was gorgeous too, honestly it was one of my favourite parts. i love that major studio animated movies are finally starting to take more risks with their animation style, moving away from the typical 3d cgi realism. you gotta respect ""spider-man: into the spider-verse"" for starting this trend and showing that different styles can work! i loved that this had a more watercolor, storybook illustration look to it, it really worked for the story and was employed in such creative ways! i would love to see the ""shrek"" movies take this on, but alas they seem to have established their own look. this movie just looked so cool, so distinct in its own style, it really felt like i was watching a story in a fairy tale world.now, of course i have to admit i didn't love this movie. something about it felt off to me, i couldn't seem to see where the acclaim was coming from. sure, it was fun, it was cute, and i enjoyed myself while watching, but i never felt like i truly connected with the film. the opening scene felt a little jumbled to me, rapidly going from a musical sequence, to comedy for kids, to an action scene and i wished it would've let me settle into the story a bit first. i get this is a movie primarily for kids, but with most animation they tend to make parts enjoyable for the parents and older audiences as well. i don't really feel that here - they tried with the themes and the deeper storyline - but it never actually worked in my eyes. everything felt very kid-focused, which isn't a bad thing, it just meant i wasn't the core audience and so it makes sense why i wouldn't enjoy it as much. i have to say, the kids in my theatre seemed to be having a blast! i'm sure this is a great movie for families with children, it just wasn't as good as i was told it would be.i think the movie tried to do a bit of what pixar is known for, the whole ""trying to be deep"" thing. the movie involves puss in boots coming to terms with death, and it seemed to be somewhat shallow, it never truly dove into this aspect of the story. instead, the storyline is very linear and somewhat dull where it is just about the characters traveling to their destination and the villains sometimes catching up and then combat ensuing. and the physical goal literally being the spiritual goal just makes the inevitable plot point of ""maybe i don't need the thing i wanted all long and it's the friends i made along the way that count"" seem all the more predictable. even puss' relationship with the side characters is unchallenging. although he is deeply flawed, his companions never seem to care about that and forgive him all the time. the chemistry of the characters was just nowhere as endearing as in ""shrek"". still the adventure was quite fun, i just didn't think the themes clicked as it felt like they were trying to be deep in a way that is not as organic and surprising as a film like pixar's ""up"", ""finding nemo"" or even dreamworks' ""how to train your dragon"".perhaps i am being too harsh, i feel like this review is sounding more negative than anything. i really did have fun with it, and overall would give it a thumbs up, it's an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half. the animation was really cool, the voice cast was great, and man i loved the little nods to the ""shrek"" movies even if i was never a huge fan of those. if nothing else, this movie did make me really hopeful for another ""shrek"" film. i do enjoy this fairy tale world and the creative animation they used to tell the story!"
"1630","interstellar","jp_91",2022-12-12,7," a visual delight. a script that could have given more.
","""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a film whose animation is excellent, full of colorful and detailed scenes, but its script becomes tired in some scenes and even predictable, although its positive message on issues of personal relationships stands out. the characters are fun, highlighting goldilocks and the three bears. antonio banderas and salma hayek manage to entertain by lending their voices to the protagonists. puss in boots is a fun character but his story lacks more irreverence like in ""shrek"". the soundtrack perfectly recreates the essence of a fairy tale. ""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a visual delight with a passable script that could have been better."
"1631","interstellar","adamlennard",2023-05-09,10," how is it this good?
","so the first movie was ok, nothing spectacular but not bad by any means, one of those you won't go out your way to watch but if it's on you'd sit and watch it. so i was quite shocked that it was getting a sequel further shocked when so many people saying how good it is, so i took my four year old and my god this is disney pixar levels of good. how is puss in boots 2 honestly one of all the time great animated films? well i'll try to explain first the animation style is beautiful and perfect for this movie and because it's a different style from the shrek universe movies it stands out. then there's the characters all the main cast are wonderfully voiced (especially the wolf) and their stories are all told so well and developed. big jack horner is one of the best movie villains for years no tragic backstory, no sympathetic qualities just evil for evils sake and loves being evil. i must also mention the wolf, this character may give younger kids nightmares but as they get older they'll appreciate how awesome he is. the music is beautiful too. i could go forever, i love this movie it is a masterpiece and a travesty it never won best animated movie at the oscar's but still i feel it's good enough love that it won't matter. the last thing i can see is a great movie makes you feel lots of different emotions and this does that ,you can laughing one minute to going aww, to crying to craping yourself in terror. this film is a masterpiece."
"1632","interstellar","deltawdunn",2023-07-17,9," one of dreamworks' best
","movies like this are the perfect counter to those who hold kid's movies to low standards. while this movie does have style, it's not particularly unique in terms of its story. it's a rather standard journey with most of what you'd expect from an animated kids movie. comedy relief sidekick, expected love interest, an irredeemable villain, etc etc... however, it does all of these so well that the predictability didn't matter. i know puss won't die, but the scenes with death are still tense because i buy puss' fear. after a while i knew goldie's wish would be for a human family and that by the end she'd learn to appreciate her bear family, but that doesn't change that it's very well done. big jack horner is cartoonishly evil, but he's the funniest character, and there are other characters who are actually well-developed so it didn't really matter. it has good action, a great opener, and some cool editing choices. aside from the great visual style and the fact that it expertly juggles three villain factions, this movie is pretty basic, but still great.it's not perfect though. in particular, i think the section at mama luna's was pretty meh. honestly, i don't think i'd care if the movie wasn't so tight, but the character mama luna herself wasn't really relevant and considering the prevalence of these scenes in the trailer, i think this could've been studio interference. maybe not though, one shouldn't assume that anything bad in a movie is due to execs.regardless, this is a great movie, easily top 5 in dreamwork's catalog, and probably higher. it's either an 8/10 or 9/10, can't really decide."
"1633","interstellar","jph-65157",2023-08-02,9," beautifully animated, cool action sequences, funny new/returning characters, and full of important life lessons.
","when i first heard about the last wish, and saw some of the trailers, i thought it was going to be a bit goofy and not as good as the first one (though seeing puss say ""no hablo ingl√©s"" to get out of talking to that dog made me chuckle) and the stylized animation looked cheap and kind of hurt my eyes and i wasn't that interested. however, once i saw a few clips of it, i thought it looked rather interesting and decided to give a shot.after i finally watched it, i have to admit it was actually very good and comparable to the first puss in boots movie and in some cases, even better. the premise was interesting, the animation actually was pretty good, the stylized animation actually worked out pretty well (especially for the action sequences), full of new characters that were funny and cool, and had some important life lessons for everyone to remember and use in their everyday lives.so i liked the premise because puss using up eight of his nine lives and trying to get to the last wish to gain them back while also battling a bunch of other characters who want the wish sets up a cool and interesting story that'll keep you hooked to see who actually gets the wish. you can kind of guess what will happen in the end, but you still want to see what happens regardless.the animation was pretty beautiful as well because although they did not use the realistic animation of the shrek movies or the first puss in boots movie, having it stylized and more comic book-like works out well here as it makes the movie look more vivid and gives you a more fairy tale vibe. plus, there were more details they could add to the characters and the scenery as well. also, as much it kind of looked cheap, the stylized animation worked out well for some of the action scenes and made them look pretty cool and graphic and added more suspense to the fight scenes between the good guys and the bad guys.the characters were also pretty cool as well. puss (once again voiced by antonio banderas) is just as funny, cool, and energetic as he always was in the previous films, kitty softpaws (once again voiced by selma hayek) adds some great humor and banter with puss once again in his mission, and the new characters were quite interesting too. perrito, the little dog (voiced by harvey guill√©n), is pretty funny and although plays the typical annoying sidekick, his role works out pretty well here as he helps puss and kitty. goldilocks and the three bears (voiced by florence pugh, olivia colman, ray winstone, and samson kayo) add some funny humor as well and their banter with each other is quite hilarious as well. big jack horner, one of the villains (voiced by john mulaney), is certainly devious and sarcastic, and his dark humor is ironically quite funny at times (i mean, if he's voiced by mulaney, then obviously it's going to be funny, due to his rather deadpan delivery of his lines).then there's the wolf (voiced by wagner moura), who serves as the other villain in this, but way darker and more sinister than jack horner. specifically, he is really the grim reaper who is after puss for him cheating death eight times and wants to take his last life as punishment, even though puss is still alive. now, when i say this character is dark, he--is--dark! like from his red eyes to his hooded figure to his low, slow, creepy sounding voice to his spine chilling/goosebump inducing whistling to his only intention of claiming puss' last life, this is a dark villain done right and probably one of the best ones in any dreamworks movie in a long time. heck, i was surprised the directors and writers made the wolf as dark as they did as it would certainly freak out some kids, and even some adults as well. at the same time though, i'll give them credit for really stepping it up here and making a very interesting and intimidating villain, as well as not making him a surprise villain too and you knew he was a villain from the beginning (the surprise villain trope has been used too much lately and it was nice to have the obvious villain trope come back once again in my opinion). i would say if you have kids, viewer discretion is advised for the wolf's scenes, but it's just a few scenes and it's not constantly.now for the themes, they were definitely important ones that i believe we all should consider in our daily lives. i won't try to spoil anything with them, but the themes presented in the last wish involve being happy with the family you grew up with even if they're not your biological family, being around people (and animals) that you can trust, and also, accepting that death is an inevitable thing, but that means living life to the fullest and enjoying every moment of it and do not waste it. again, not trying to spoil too much, but they were presented really well in the last wish that will definitely grasp your attention and might even get you thinking about how things are going with your life and might make you consider making some better changes for yourself.alright, so i know that was a lot to say here, but i just wanted to go over everything that i liked about the last wish. i know it's been out for a while now, but for those who haven't seen it yet, i'd recommend giving it a chance because it's definitely one of the better animated movies that have come out in recent years and it's one that i'm sure you'll love instantly once you watch it. it does have its serious moments, but it has a good blend of that and humor and some touching moments that hit you in the feels. lastly, if you're a fan of puss in boots, then seeing him in action once again will definitely satisfy your movie going needs.so if you have netflix, apple tv, or any other streaming service puss in boots: the last wish is on, go watch it!!!"

","it was a refreshing experience, this beautiful story tells you the importance of the one life we all got. after a long time, i watched a dreamworks animated movie. well, it tried to make a new animation style, taking inspiration from 'into the spider-verse' 2d effects but also not losing their original stylized 3d style, i like it.fairy tale and say what, a fun & life moral centric story focuses on puss's story, making him take life seriously and that's interesting. but the best part of the whole movie was, the antagonist, death... i mean hat's off to death's acting, dialogues, and animation, you can count him as one of the coldest villains on your list. his whistle literally is scary, it feels good to listen but the tone isolates, as if it's a warning that death is coming to you. he is the highlight of this movie. also, i personally, like the story of the side characters, goldi and bears, or probably i liked goldi's character design and character arc.i'll recommend if you looking for something fun and life refreshing story, then definitely check this out because i bet you will be impressed by death's presence in scenes."

","'puss in boots: the last wish (2022)' is brilliant. teeming with energy from the moment it begins, this animated adventure is as exhilarating as it is emotionally mature. it balances its swashbuckling action, quick-witted comedy, emotional character work and surprisingly poignant musings on mortality incredibly well. there isn't a moment of the perfectly paced piece that feels out of pace. it truly is an absolute blast. it's also beautiful, with stylishly snappy animation that immediately grabs you by the collar and drags you into the colourful storybook setting. the action scenes, in particular, are a real highlight; you're sure to have a smile on your face for each and every one. except, perhaps, those involving the wolf - not because they aren't wonderful, but because they're shockingly scary. the big bad is genuinely terrifying on occasion and his introductory scene is nothing short of a masterpiece. the internal conflict he inspires in the central character is arguably what elevates the picture to another level, and the literal manifestations of this conflict are inarguably the highlights of the entire affair. the characters all have a good amount of depth to them and they're brought to life with vital voicework that never misses a beat. even the usually annoying cute sidekick is here a sincere, funny and likeable presence that adds genuine value to the narrative. there's very little not to like here. one thing that's perhaps worth mentioning is that there's one scene in which a certain character seems to have been rendered unlit, leading to a distracting sense that the shots in which they appear are literally unfinished. some of the character arcs are predictable and there are a couple of jokes that don't quite land, too. these really are very minor flaws, though. ultimately, this is a ton of fun from start to finish. it's the sort of thing that puts a smile on your face simply because of how well achieved it is. it's phenomenal."

"1651","interstellar","deltawdunn",2023-07-17,9," one of dreamworks' best
","movies like this are the perfect counter to those who hold kid's movies to low standards. while this movie does have style, it's not particularly unique in terms of its story. it's a rather standard journey with most of what you'd expect from an animated kids movie. comedy relief sidekick, expected love interest, an irredeemable villain, etc etc... however, it does all of these so well that the predictability didn't matter. i know puss won't die, but the scenes with death are still tense because i buy puss' fear. after a while i knew goldie's wish would be for a human family and that by the end she'd learn to appreciate her bear family, but that doesn't change that it's very well done. big jack horner is cartoonishly evil, but he's the funniest character, and there are other characters who are actually well-developed so it didn't really matter. it has good action, a great opener, and some cool editing choices. aside from the great visual style and the fact that it expertly juggles three villain factions, this movie is pretty basic, but still great.it's not perfect though. in particular, i think the section at mama luna's was pretty meh. honestly, i don't think i'd care if the movie wasn't so tight, but the character mama luna herself wasn't really relevant and considering the prevalence of these scenes in the trailer, i think this could've been studio interference. maybe not though, one shouldn't assume that anything bad in a movie is due to execs.regardless, this is a great movie, easily top 5 in dreamwork's catalog, and probably higher. it's either an 8/10 or 9/10, can't really decide."
"1652","interstellar","jph-65157",2023-08-02,9," beautifully animated, cool action sequences, funny new/returning characters, and full of important life lessons.
","when i first heard about the last wish, and saw some of the trailers, i thought it was going to be a bit goofy and not as good as the first one (though seeing puss say ""no hablo ingl√©s"" to get out of talking to that dog made me chuckle) and the stylized animation looked cheap and kind of hurt my eyes and i wasn't that interested. however, once i saw a few clips of it, i thought it looked rather interesting and decided to give a shot.after i finally watched it, i have to admit it was actually very good and comparable to the first puss in boots movie and in some cases, even better. the premise was interesting, the animation actually was pretty good, the stylized animation actually worked out pretty well (especially for the action sequences), full of new characters that were funny and cool, and had some important life lessons for everyone to remember and use in their everyday lives.so i liked the premise because puss using up eight of his nine lives and trying to get to the last wish to gain them back while also battling a bunch of other characters who want the wish sets up a cool and interesting story that'll keep you hooked to see who actually gets the wish. you can kind of guess what will happen in the end, but you still want to see what happens regardless.the animation was pretty beautiful as well because although they did not use the realistic animation of the shrek movies or the first puss in boots movie, having it stylized and more comic book-like works out well here as it makes the movie look more vivid and gives you a more fairy tale vibe. plus, there were more details they could add to the characters and the scenery as well. also, as much it kind of looked cheap, the stylized animation worked out well for some of the action scenes and made them look pretty cool and graphic and added more suspense to the fight scenes between the good guys and the bad guys.the characters were also pretty cool as well. puss (once again voiced by antonio banderas) is just as funny, cool, and energetic as he always was in the previous films, kitty softpaws (once again voiced by selma hayek) adds some great humor and banter with puss once again in his mission, and the new characters were quite interesting too. perrito, the little dog (voiced by harvey guill√©n), is pretty funny and although plays the typical annoying sidekick, his role works out pretty well here as he helps puss and kitty. goldilocks and the three bears (voiced by florence pugh, olivia colman, ray winstone, and samson kayo) add some funny humor as well and their banter with each other is quite hilarious as well. big jack horner, one of the villains (voiced by john mulaney), is certainly devious and sarcastic, and his dark humor is ironically quite funny at times (i mean, if he's voiced by mulaney, then obviously it's going to be funny, due to his rather deadpan delivery of his lines).then there's the wolf (voiced by wagner moura), who serves as the other villain in this, but way darker and more sinister than jack horner. specifically, he is really the grim reaper who is after puss for him cheating death eight times and wants to take his last life as punishment, even though puss is still alive. now, when i say this character is dark, he--is--dark! like from his red eyes to his hooded figure to his low, slow, creepy sounding voice to his spine chilling/goosebump inducing whistling to his only intention of claiming puss' last life, this is a dark villain done right and probably one of the best ones in any dreamworks movie in a long time. heck, i was surprised the directors and writers made the wolf as dark as they did as it would certainly freak out some kids, and even some adults as well. at the same time though, i'll give them credit for really stepping it up here and making a very interesting and intimidating villain, as well as not making him a surprise villain too and you knew he was a villain from the beginning (the surprise villain trope has been used too much lately and it was nice to have the obvious villain trope come back once again in my opinion). i would say if you have kids, viewer discretion is advised for the wolf's scenes, but it's just a few scenes and it's not constantly.now for the themes, they were definitely important ones that i believe we all should consider in our daily lives. i won't try to spoil anything with them, but the themes presented in the last wish involve being happy with the family you grew up with even if they're not your biological family, being around people (and animals) that you can trust, and also, accepting that death is an inevitable thing, but that means living life to the fullest and enjoying every moment of it and do not waste it. again, not trying to spoil too much, but they were presented really well in the last wish that will definitely grasp your attention and might even get you thinking about how things are going with your life and might make you consider making some better changes for yourself.alright, so i know that was a lot to say here, but i just wanted to go over everything that i liked about the last wish. i know it's been out for a while now, but for those who haven't seen it yet, i'd recommend giving it a chance because it's definitely one of the better animated movies that have come out in recent years and it's one that i'm sure you'll love instantly once you watch it. it does have its serious moments, but it has a good blend of that and humor and some touching moments that hit you in the feels. lastly, if you're a fan of puss in boots, then seeing him in action once again will definitely satisfy your movie going needs.so if you have netflix, apple tv, or any other streaming service puss in boots: the last wish is on, go watch it!!!"
"1653","interstellar","monuthube",2023-07-01,9," a good-fun refreshing story of the fear of death
","it was a refreshing experience, this beautiful story tells you the importance of the one life we all got. after a long time, i watched a dreamworks animated movie. well, it tried to make a new animation style, taking inspiration from 'into the spider-verse' 2d effects but also not losing their original stylized 3d style, i like it.fairy tale and say what, a fun & life moral centric story focuses on puss's story, making him take life seriously and that's interesting. but the best part of the whole movie was, the antagonist, death... i mean hat's off to death's acting, dialogues, and animation, you can count him as one of the coldest villains on your list. his whistle literally is scary, it feels good to listen but the tone isolates, as if it's a warning that death is coming to you. he is the highlight of this movie. also, i personally, like the story of the side characters, goldi and bears, or probably i liked goldi's character design and character arc.i'll recommend if you looking for something fun and life refreshing story, then definitely check this out because i bet you will be impressed by death's presence in scenes."

","better than the first one, i went to watch it three times with different people and it keeps getting better. why? because the story is deeper than it seems. the humor is quite irresistible. the animation is gorgeous. i was starting to think that computer animated films were something of the past but it is more that disney/pixar are exhausted and there is still space for good stories and original animation. and there is no preaching. you don't feel you are in a reeducation camp. still there is a strong and uplifting message. i guess it is how you do it disney! puss aside, my favorite character was jack horner, who is ultra weird and super funny at the same time."

","'puss in boots: the last wish (2022)' is brilliant. teeming with energy from the moment it begins, this animated adventure is as exhilarating as it is emotionally mature. it balances its swashbuckling action, quick-witted comedy, emotional character work and surprisingly poignant musings on mortality incredibly well. there isn't a moment of the perfectly paced piece that feels out of pace. it truly is an absolute blast. it's also beautiful, with stylishly snappy animation that immediately grabs you by the collar and drags you into the colourful storybook setting. the action scenes, in particular, are a real highlight; you're sure to have a smile on your face for each and every one. except, perhaps, those involving the wolf - not because they aren't wonderful, but because they're shockingly scary. the big bad is genuinely terrifying on occasion and his introductory scene is nothing short of a masterpiece. the internal conflict he inspires in the central character is arguably what elevates the picture to another level, and the literal manifestations of this conflict are inarguably the highlights of the entire affair. the characters all have a good amount of depth to them and they're brought to life with vital voicework that never misses a beat. even the usually annoying cute sidekick is here a sincere, funny and likeable presence that adds genuine value to the narrative. there's very little not to like here. one thing that's perhaps worth mentioning is that there's one scene in which a certain character seems to have been rendered unlit, leading to a distracting sense that the shots in which they appear are literally unfinished. some of the character arcs are predictable and there are a couple of jokes that don't quite land, too. these really are very minor flaws, though. ultimately, this is a ton of fun from start to finish. it's the sort of thing that puts a smile on your face simply because of how well achieved it is. it's phenomenal."

puss in boots discovers that his passion for adventure has taken its toll: he has burned through eight of his nine lives. puss sets out on an epic journey to find the mythical last wish and restore his nine lives.the co-directors of the colorful dreamworks film are joel crawford and januel mercado. the screenplay was written by tommy swerdlow and paul fisher, based on the story by tom wheeler.things i liked:
we had to wait 11 years since the last puss boots movie came out in 2011. was it worth it? most audiences are saying yes.antonio banderas is awesome. he can do it all: drama, comedy, musical. i love how he really exaggerates the spanish accent from spain. i lived in spain for a couple of years and adore that beautiful country and its people. i laughed out loud when he properly pronounced ""gazpacho"" with the spanish theta.he and salma hayek make a natural pairing with their comedic timing and hispanic accents.listen for the voices of these talented actors: florence pugh, academy award-winner olivia colman, comedian john mulaney, harvey guillen, da'vine joy randolph, samson kayo, ray winstone, and wagner moura.i laughed out loud so many times. there is so much animated humor, as well as spoken humor.this addition to the puss in boots franchise does a great job of reminding us that puss isn't just a suave fighter, but an actual cat. there's a cuteness battle between puss and kitty that makes for another laugh-out-loud moment.the opening sequence is full of action and humor. what a way to start off a movie in a strong way!the sequence that shows how many times puss in boots died is hilarious.due to the almost non-stop action, the movie has a palpable energy.we see an interesting mixture of 2d and 3d events, keeping things interesting visually, as well as creating a more adventurous look.the story includes several groups of people who are all after the same prize: the ultimate fairytale prize of a wish. the filmmakers explained they were influenced by the famous western movie the good, the bad, and the ugly from 1966. each set of characters has its own story arc with meaningful lessons to be learned along the way.i loved the sweet moment when a certain character started to have a panic attack and was able to calm down by simply petting a soft dog. therapy dogs serve a real and valuable service for many people who need extra support.i hope this addition to the revived shrek universe means we're going to see some more of these fun characters soon.things i didn't like:
parents might get a headache from all the chaotic noise and action.some of the voices didn't match the characters' designs.too many villains and characters to keep track of.it's sad to watch puss in boots wilt under the pressure of imminent death.tips for parents:
this is a movie that all ages will enjoy!alcohol
cartoon violence

","i can't believe it took me a year to finally see this movie. puss in boots: the last wish (pretty terrible title notwithstanding) is an animated masterpiece. it's essentially distilled the formula of what works in an animated family film to such an extent that it feels almost easy, as if the movie wrote itself.this film has such a clever, funny, charming script that hits all of the beats that families will love. you have a dashing hero, a sophisticated love interest, a cute companion, a compelling mcguffin for our characters to chase after, a fully realized and living fantasy world, fun easter eggs, and not one, not two, but three villains who all fit perfectly into the story. it's a film with great and surprisingly weighty themes about what makes life worth living, the inevitable prospect of death, about family, redemption, good and evil.one aspect of the film i really loved was how it handled its villains. we have three, as mentioned before, but all of them play a specific role and communicate pretty fantastic ideas to kids. goldilocks & the bears are the sympathetic lot tossed into villainy because of (somewhat understandable) circumstance. the big bad wolf is a personification of the inevitability of death and other aspects of evil we can't escape. and jack horner, perhaps best of all, reminds kids that no, not all people can be redeemed. some people are just purely evil and you should avoid them.the script is also super tight, full of satisfying call backs, excellent character moments for every single member of the cast...and a lot of that has to do with the animation as well.it's a year later, so you don't need anyone to tell you about how gorgeous this movie looks; into the spiderverse and its eclectic, mesmerizing 2.5d style of animation is the best thing to happen to american animation since pixar. the movie is lush, beautiful, and colourful, but also is an excellent showcase for why animation just might be our best medium of storytelling. i kept thinking of how efficient this film was with conveying information and realized, of course it is, it's animated. there's so much you can do here that you can't with live action, and this film truly internalizes that. puss in boots isn't a great movie in spite of being animated. it's a great movie because it's animated."
"1672","interstellar","themysteriousreviewer",2023-08-05,9," awesome than ever
","when i first heard of this movie, i thought it would be a sequel that i wouldn't mind than to just milk the shrek franchise. but honestly, i was just surprised of how awesome it turned out to be. puss in boots: the last wish is the best shrek movie we have gotten in a long time. it has made a comeback to the character eleven years later and was even better than the predecessor with an exciting and intense story, amazingly upgraded animation, likable characters, and an addition to spice up the movie with death as one of the best villains dreamworks has created. but what truly makes the movie better is with a great moral of living one life. having one life is all we all have left and we should enjoy while we last. if you love the shrek franchise (well, most likely for the first two), i think you will have a blast with this one. last year has been a great year for the studio, and i believe with this movie and the bad guys, they seem are going to start making better movies. alright dreamworks, you win. you can have shrek 5, but please make that worth it."

","i never would have imagined that a sequel to an 11 year old shrek spinoff would end up being one of the best animated films i've seen in years, but somehow here we are...
puss in boots the last wish is a pleasant surprise in just about every way, bringing us an exciting new adventure for everyone's favourite sword-wielding kitty cat!a lot has changed and evolved with animated films in the last decade, so naturally this film represents a huge visual upgrade over the original film.instead of taking the logical route, making everything more detailed and crisp, this film takes a stylistic approach that really pays off!every image you see just pops like paintings ready to leap off the screen.the way the film changes up the frame rate for the thrilling action sequences is not only creative, but looks absolutely phenomenal too!despite over a decade passing since antonio banderas' last outing as puss, he slips back into the boots like it was yesterday!this is arguably one of his most iconic roles, and his voice performance reminds us why...
from salma hayek's retuning character to new characters played by florence pugh and john mulaney, everyone delivers top notch voice work!wagner moura is on another level though, bringing one of dreamworks' most truly terrifying villains to life with an exceptional performance.those glowing blood coloured eyes and that spine chilling whistle...honestly nightmare fuel!with his darth maul-esque dual sickle staff, dreamworks has created the coolest villain i have ever seen in an animated film in decades!the film expertly navigates some heavy themes, like coming to terms with mortality and what it means to appreciate the life you've been given...
it's presented in a way that children will understand, but adults will truly appreciate.the lessons the characters learn are a bit predictable, but they always land with sincerity, making them effective and meaningful.overall, puss in boots the last wish is a sequel i never knew i wanted, but if this is the kind of quality and creativity this franchise is capable of, sign me up for a third film...
vibrant animation, a powerful story and excellent voice work all around prove this fan favourite character still has claws!"

","this funny, charming and adorable, yet often quite dark, gloomy and intense puss in boots adventure isn't your typical cash-grabbing kids' movie. it's been over a decade since the first puss in boots movie, which was a spin-off in the shrek franchise featuring the loveable ginger cat in tiny boots wielding a mini sword. but this is unashamedly the best they've done since the first and second shrek movies.when puss in boots learns that he's already burnt through eight of his nine lives, he embarks on an epic quest to find the mythical wishing star to restore his lives. get it? because cats have nine lives? anyway, it's a pretty simple storyline that doesn't sound, and isn't really too complicated. however, this movie isn't getting all the praise for its animation techniques, vocal performances and all of that, although it definitely deserves major credit for the cast's brilliant work and the gorgeous 3d animation style that likes to pick some moments to do in a clever, witty 2d.forgivably, you can never expect a family comedy in theatres that isn't guaranteed to have its extended moments of silly humour, but these very occasional scenes don't overtake the heavy themes this movie wants to consider, which is actually life and death. there are three parties of antagonists, some who are more villainy than the others, but there's fairy tale characters goldilocks, the three bears and jack horner, and similar to the party this movie features as the protagonists, they all have meaning, struggles and thoughtful backstories to them. but it's the main villain who appears as a whistling wolf who provides the sense of dread. and when you take into consideration villain construction, appearances and overall sense of menace, he's one of the best antagonists of the year.if you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews."

","set in the nostalgic mid-2000's, saltburn follows a quiet but sinister student called oliver (played by barry keoghan, at his most creepy) who ingratiates himself into his posh friend's aristocratic family, with questionable motives.over the course of the film, oliver morphs into a vampiric sociopath, growing on this family like a tumour, as the film tries to ham-fistedly explore themes of jealousy, lust and social inequity.the tumour analogy is also apt, because watching this film was about as comfortable as a colorectal exam. what follows for two excruciating hours is a long-winded attempt at a dark-humoured drama, where we meet gaggle of unlikeable, two-dimensional toffs who are slowly exploited by creepy little oliver. to maintain the audience's attention, these encounters are then interspersed with (what else?) gratuitous, feral sex scenes, purely for shock value.written and directed by emerald fennell, herself a wealthy heiress who undoubtedly made it in hollywood thanks to her social privilege, her attempts to explore these themes of class and envy fall completely flat, especially if you contextualise the them through her gaze. the irony here is really astounding.like fennell's first film, promising young woman, which won a sympathy oscar due to its topical (but superficial) expos√© of an important narrative, this too was an unimaginative attempt of a worthwhile subject where nothing worthwhile was actually said. fennell again is out of her depth, despite her results being only puddle-deep. the end result seemed more like a series of quirky vignettes featuring disdainful a******es, stitched together to form a slow and pretentious melodrama.in fairness to fennell, the cinematography and soundtrack are both vivid and catchy. fennell's 'vibe' and visual instinct would be perfect for a raunchy music video; she could even be described as a reasonable director in a such a role. but with saltburn, her writing (and the movie's social media marketing) is aligned towards this new tiktok generation: vulgar, debased, and playing up to the soundbite-loving, shock-valued meme culture.nothing of substance was made here.if you want dark-humoured social commentary, see parasite. if you want sordid absurdity (with awkward sex scenes that actually benefit the plot!), see dogtooth. and if you have completely lost touch with reality and think this movie is any way a piece of avant-garde artistry, i suggest you take a walk outside and remind yourself what a tree looks like."

","'saltburn (2023)' is an incredibly horny movie. it's easily one of the most bisexual films i've seen at the cinema, with a down-bad lead who seemingly wants to have sex with everyone he meets and cinematography that frames the characters as if any of them could start making out with one another at any given moment. seriously, it's as if the camera operators themselves want to get in on the action. pretty much every major player - jacob elordi's felix, in particular - is shot with a sweaty sexuality that lends them an almost ethereal allure. it's like they're actively trying to seduce you through the screen, which the picture itself is attempting in its own way. the female gaze doesn't really exist, but if it did it would look like this; i finally know something about what it must feel like for a straight woman to watch, well, practically anything with a 'sexy' female character in it. at a certain point, the sexual tension snaps with a series of unashamedly shocking, near gross-out gags involving various bodily fluids and unexpected sex acts. the audience i was watching this with were audibly squirming in their seats at some of the more outrageous moments, and perhaps rightfully so. these are undoubtedly the moments which have caused many people to declare the back half of this ""really weird"", and they do kind of come out of nowhere - if not in their inclusion then in their perceived depravity. however, i don't think the second half of the flick is any less successful than the first, and it actually feels like a fairly natural progression of the plot. it's unorthodox, sure, and it starts to sew the first seeds in your mind that maybe the protagonist isn't quite as innocent as he first appears. the general subversiveness of the story does go quite a long way in keeping you invested, as you're never quite sure what's going to happen next or what the characters are actually thinking (or if they're even thinking at all). there's something off about everything at saltburn from the moment it's introduced, and the flick builds this underlying sense of suspense that kind of sneaks up on you. even if its ultimate reveal is handled fairly clumsily, most of the narrative is compelling enough to mostly justify the 130-minute runtime. it helps that the performances are all rock solid, including some expectedly fantastic work from barry keoghan, and that the writing keenly balances dark absurdism with disturbing satire. the cinematography has an appealing almost polaroid - or perhaps 8mm home movie - feel thanks to its 4:3 framing and notable film grain. the film is comprised almost exclusively of interestingly framed, often downright beautiful shots that frequently make perfect use of silhouette and satisfyingly unconventional composition. it's all edited together in a notably excellent fashion, featuring some bracingly vibrant montages that make use of repeated motifs to recontextualise previously seen material. it's a really well-made movie overall, and its narrative is more consistent than a lot of people seem to think. it does get ever-so-slightly repetitive in its midsection and some of its first act could arguably be trimmed, but it's a consistently engaging and darkly funny / funnily dark experience for most of its duration. the ending is a little inelegant, the theming isn't particularly deep and some of its more outlandish moments feel crafted almost solely for shock value, but this is a solid and unconventional feature that almost defies genre and is all the better for it."

","this film starts off well with a good cast and interesting premise. as things darken and begin to twist it handles things well with some ott. characterisation but still remains entertaining. unfortunately once the main reveal happens it then continues to hit the viewer over the head with a hammer constantly and the ending and subsequent explanation seemed twice as long as it needed to be and brutally patronising. shame, with more sublety was promising and worked like a decent enough horror / class commentary film. not a film you are likely to forget, just not for all the right reasons. weak female and secondary characters didn't help, although the main character is pretty androgynous. the sister ( or one of the servants) could have been so much more interesting and been a good saviour near the end. not sure why we needed the last scene and if this is a class commentary, what about the servants at the end? after watching with a friend who hadn't seen withnail and i, decided it to be a much better proposition."
"1703","interstellar","bardmore",2023-12-24,3," a gorgeous and baffling mess
","saltburn is mesmerizingly incomprehensible and utterly pretentious. its most intriguing quality is attempting to make sense of its dizzyingly absurd and unbelievable plot. the mere mention of the incomparable brideshead revisited in the same breath is near blasphemy. the characters are devoid of any dimension and lack motivation in their robotic machinations. some scenes are slow and agonizingly long, while some scenes that have a whiff of emotion, such as when oliver and felix go to oliver's parents, are frustratingly cut short of development and resolution. moreover, barry keoghan as super oxford student is about as convincing as elizabeth warren's assertion that she is a cherokee indian. thankfully there is jacob elordi whose raffish good looks and spirited performance, as well as that of rosalind pike., bring much needed relief to the absurd proceedings. on the plus side are the gorgeous settings and frequently beautiful music, but nonetheless they are not enough to make up for the mind-numbing script. and that last scene!!! heaven help us."

","saltburn, a sophomore feature by emerald fennell, has been a subject of debate among critics and viewers. some view the film as flashy and self-satisfied, while others see it as a successful erotic thriller with titillating shocks. the film has had a successful limited release in the us and expanded nationwide. however, some critics argue that the film's visuals, such as a character slurping another's bathwater and a cocky ending, may be a sign of perverse genius or cheap tricks masquerading as it. the film has gained popularity on tiktok, with many expressing a rift between its staff and the film's overall aesthetic. the saltburn divide is not a satire film but rather its artifices, including visual provocations, luxe tableaus, and bold telegraphing of desire. vibes are a powerful tool in cinema, allowing audiences to process entertainment that is predominantly based on them. they can be a portal to the intangible particulars of another time, place, or era, as seen in sofia coppola's impressionistic priscilla. many festival circuit films this year, such as raven jackson's all dirt roads taste of salt, jonathan glazer's zone of interest, annie baker's janet planet, and steve mcqueen's occupied city, use feelings, mood, visual language, and sensory experience to communicate the unspoken human experience. these films argue against the tyranny of story in how we evaluate screen-based media, allowing audiences to experience the unspoken human experience through their cinematic experiences. saltburn is a film by fennell that showcases the eccentricities of its characters, but it lacks a cohesive plot. the film's main problem is that most of its plotting is saved for the final stretch, with fennell being vague about everyone's motivations and actions. this results in the film drifting along and suddenly hurries through several major revelations with the speed of someone who wants to reach the end of an anecdote before their phone battery runs out. some of these revelations are more ingenious than others, but fennell is prone to fumble them and has little to say about class divisions that hasn't been said more pithily in several recent films. saltburn may seem half-hearted and lacks the focused anger of promising young woman. however, if seen as a lurid pulp fantasy rather than a penetrating satire, it is deliriously enjoyable. the dialogue and performances are what clinch it, with oliver being awestruck by the priceless old masters on the house's oak-panelled walls and pike, grant, and mulligan competing to be the most obnoxious. keoghan delivers an impressively committed performance in a movie that considers itself shocking, with ""saltburn's"" final scene being the most true representation. the film's beauty and emptyness are evident, but fennell's set-up leaves viewers wanting more. the final scene is a bravura tracking shot."

","'saltburn (2023)' is an incredibly horny movie. it's easily one of the most bisexual films i've seen at the cinema, with a down-bad lead who seemingly wants to have sex with everyone he meets and cinematography that frames the characters as if any of them could start making out with one another at any given moment. seriously, it's as if the camera operators themselves want to get in on the action. pretty much every major player - jacob elordi's felix, in particular - is shot with a sweaty sexuality that lends them an almost ethereal allure. it's like they're actively trying to seduce you through the screen, which the picture itself is attempting in its own way. the female gaze doesn't really exist, but if it did it would look like this; i finally know something about what it must feel like for a straight woman to watch, well, practically anything with a 'sexy' female character in it. at a certain point, the sexual tension snaps with a series of unashamedly shocking, near gross-out gags involving various bodily fluids and unexpected sex acts. the audience i was watching this with were audibly squirming in their seats at some of the more outrageous moments, and perhaps rightfully so. these are undoubtedly the moments which have caused many people to declare the back half of this ""really weird"", and they do kind of come out of nowhere - if not in their inclusion then in their perceived depravity. however, i don't think the second half of the flick is any less successful than the first, and it actually feels like a fairly natural progression of the plot. it's unorthodox, sure, and it starts to sew the first seeds in your mind that maybe the protagonist isn't quite as innocent as he first appears. the general subversiveness of the story does go quite a long way in keeping you invested, as you're never quite sure what's going to happen next or what the characters are actually thinking (or if they're even thinking at all). there's something off about everything at saltburn from the moment it's introduced, and the flick builds this underlying sense of suspense that kind of sneaks up on you. even if its ultimate reveal is handled fairly clumsily, most of the narrative is compelling enough to mostly justify the 130-minute runtime. it helps that the performances are all rock solid, including some expectedly fantastic work from barry keoghan, and that the writing keenly balances dark absurdism with disturbing satire. the cinematography has an appealing almost polaroid - or perhaps 8mm home movie - feel thanks to its 4:3 framing and notable film grain. the film is comprised almost exclusively of interestingly framed, often downright beautiful shots that frequently make perfect use of silhouette and satisfyingly unconventional composition. it's all edited together in a notably excellent fashion, featuring some bracingly vibrant montages that make use of repeated motifs to recontextualise previously seen material. it's a really well-made movie overall, and its narrative is more consistent than a lot of people seem to think. it does get ever-so-slightly repetitive in its midsection and some of its first act could arguably be trimmed, but it's a consistently engaging and darkly funny / funnily dark experience for most of its duration. the ending is a little inelegant, the theming isn't particularly deep and some of its more outlandish moments feel crafted almost solely for shock value, but this is a solid and unconventional feature that almost defies genre and is all the better for it."

","saltburn, a sophomore feature by emerald fennell, has been a subject of debate among critics and viewers. some view the film as flashy and self-satisfied, while others see it as a successful erotic thriller with titillating shocks. the film has had a successful limited release in the us and expanded nationwide. however, some critics argue that the film's visuals, such as a character slurping another's bathwater and a cocky ending, may be a sign of perverse genius or cheap tricks masquerading as it. the film has gained popularity on tiktok, with many expressing a rift between its staff and the film's overall aesthetic. the saltburn divide is not a satire film but rather its artifices, including visual provocations, luxe tableaus, and bold telegraphing of desire. vibes are a powerful tool in cinema, allowing audiences to process entertainment that is predominantly based on them. they can be a portal to the intangible particulars of another time, place, or era, as seen in sofia coppola's impressionistic priscilla. many festival circuit films this year, such as raven jackson's all dirt roads taste of salt, jonathan glazer's zone of interest, annie baker's janet planet, and steve mcqueen's occupied city, use feelings, mood, visual language, and sensory experience to communicate the unspoken human experience. these films argue against the tyranny of story in how we evaluate screen-based media, allowing audiences to experience the unspoken human experience through their cinematic experiences. saltburn is a film by fennell that showcases the eccentricities of its characters, but it lacks a cohesive plot. the film's main problem is that most of its plotting is saved for the final stretch, with fennell being vague about everyone's motivations and actions. this results in the film drifting along and suddenly hurries through several major revelations with the speed of someone who wants to reach the end of an anecdote before their phone battery runs out. some of these revelations are more ingenious than others, but fennell is prone to fumble them and has little to say about class divisions that hasn't been said more pithily in several recent films. saltburn may seem half-hearted and lacks the focused anger of promising young woman. however, if seen as a lurid pulp fantasy rather than a penetrating satire, it is deliriously enjoyable. the dialogue and performances are what clinch it, with oliver being awestruck by the priceless old masters on the house's oak-panelled walls and pike, grant, and mulligan competing to be the most obnoxious. keoghan delivers an impressively committed performance in a movie that considers itself shocking, with ""saltburn's"" final scene being the most true representation. the film's beauty and emptyness are evident, but fennell's set-up leaves viewers wanting more. the final scene is a bravura tracking shot."

","director/screenwriter emerald fennell appears to relish pushing all our buttons when she targets class envy and relentless obsession in this dark 2023 hybrid of black comedy and psychological thriller. same as her directorial debut, ""promising young woman"", the story centers on a fractured personality, this time a shy but resourceful oxford scholarship student named oliver, who latches on to felix, a handsome party boy who comes from a filthy rich aristocratic family, the members of which lead vacuous, insulated lives. plotwise, it's pretty obvious where the story is going, especially if you've seen ""the talented mr. ripley"", but fennell displays a wicked and often cavalier sense of humor in sorting out the fates of her ethically challenged characters. the film's more pressing problem though is how superficial the plot remains with only a minimum of emotional investment allocated. regardless, the cast is game with barry keoghan properly elliptical as oliver and jacob elordi effortlessly charismatic as felix. however, as felix's clueless parents, richard e. grant and especially rosamund pike steal the film with their shrewdly observed turns. carey mulligan shows up briefly as a forlorn bohemian party guest. there are nice satirical jabs and genuinely uncomfortable moments, but the film just refuses to go deep."

","saltburn, a sophomore feature by emerald fennell, has been a subject of debate among critics and viewers. some view the film as flashy and self-satisfied, while others see it as a successful erotic thriller with titillating shocks. the film has had a successful limited release in the us and expanded nationwide. however, some critics argue that the film's visuals, such as a character slurping another's bathwater and a cocky ending, may be a sign of perverse genius or cheap tricks masquerading as it. the film has gained popularity on tiktok, with many expressing a rift between its staff and the film's overall aesthetic. the saltburn divide is not a satire film but rather its artifices, including visual provocations, luxe tableaus, and bold telegraphing of desire. vibes are a powerful tool in cinema, allowing audiences to process entertainment that is predominantly based on them. they can be a portal to the intangible particulars of another time, place, or era, as seen in sofia coppola's impressionistic priscilla. many festival circuit films this year, such as raven jackson's all dirt roads taste of salt, jonathan glazer's zone of interest, annie baker's janet planet, and steve mcqueen's occupied city, use feelings, mood, visual language, and sensory experience to communicate the unspoken human experience. these films argue against the tyranny of story in how we evaluate screen-based media, allowing audiences to experience the unspoken human experience through their cinematic experiences. saltburn is a film by fennell that showcases the eccentricities of its characters, but it lacks a cohesive plot. the film's main problem is that most of its plotting is saved for the final stretch, with fennell being vague about everyone's motivations and actions. this results in the film drifting along and suddenly hurries through several major revelations with the speed of someone who wants to reach the end of an anecdote before their phone battery runs out. some of these revelations are more ingenious than others, but fennell is prone to fumble them and has little to say about class divisions that hasn't been said more pithily in several recent films. saltburn may seem half-hearted and lacks the focused anger of promising young woman. however, if seen as a lurid pulp fantasy rather than a penetrating satire, it is deliriously enjoyable. the dialogue and performances are what clinch it, with oliver being awestruck by the priceless old masters on the house's oak-panelled walls and pike, grant, and mulligan competing to be the most obnoxious. keoghan delivers an impressively committed performance in a movie that considers itself shocking, with ""saltburn's"" final scene being the most true representation. the film's beauty and emptyness are evident, but fennell's set-up leaves viewers wanting more. the final scene is a bravura tracking shot."

","director/screenwriter emerald fennell appears to relish pushing all our buttons when she targets class envy and relentless obsession in this dark 2023 hybrid of black comedy and psychological thriller. same as her directorial debut, ""promising young woman"", the story centers on a fractured personality, this time a shy but resourceful oxford scholarship student named oliver, who latches on to felix, a handsome party boy who comes from a filthy rich aristocratic family, the members of which lead vacuous, insulated lives. plotwise, it's pretty obvious where the story is going, especially if you've seen ""the talented mr. ripley"", but fennell displays a wicked and often cavalier sense of humor in sorting out the fates of her ethically challenged characters. the film's more pressing problem though is how superficial the plot remains with only a minimum of emotional investment allocated. regardless, the cast is game with barry keoghan properly elliptical as oliver and jacob elordi effortlessly charismatic as felix. however, as felix's clueless parents, richard e. grant and especially rosamund pike steal the film with their shrewdly observed turns. carey mulligan shows up briefly as a forlorn bohemian party guest. there are nice satirical jabs and genuinely uncomfortable moments, but the film just refuses to go deep."

","i got to see the dark knight on wednesday night, the reason though why i'm writing this movie comment this late is because i didn't wanna just jump and say this movie was awesome, i wanted to think it through, still today, i can't stop thinking about this movie! the dark knight lives up to it's hype and goes beyond it, this is the batman movie that goes where no other batman movie has gone before. it gave us a real sold story, we are finally told why the villains are the way they are, how all the injustice in the world can get underneath batman's skin, how you have to believe that people still have faith in good on earth. heath ledger, i absolutely loved jack nicolson's performance in the 1989 film, when i first read that heath was signed onto the dark knight, i was like ""what are they, kidding?"", once you see the dark knight... heath was incredible! i'm not going to compare jack and heath's performance, because they were two different versions of the joker, but heath's joker was definitely the more scary and intense of the two nominations. you didn't know what he was going to do next, he was so crazy, he was also so charismatic to the point where you could relate to his character, and the worst part is not only that he's crazy, he's driving gotham crazy and treating everyone like little puppets on strings that he can control, and guess what, he is doing it so well with a smile on his face. this was so much more than a batman film, this was so much more than a comic book film, the dark knight truly delivers with drama, action, romance, horror, dark humor, the study of a psychopathic killer, a detective story. the force behind this epic movie is christopher nolan, who's previous film, batman begins, didn't really thrill me, but his incredible film making is truly shown in the dark knight, the shots that he got of gotham city were absolutely fantastic and made you feel part of the city, part of the batman story. one of the things that i absolutely loved about the dark knight is that normally with a comic book movie, you know it's not real, people don't dress up in costumes, and save the day, villains don't name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes, but the dark knight actually makes it seem incredibly real, like it could happen.bruce wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of batman and himself, he has lost rachel to the new district attorney, harvey dent, he's inspiring others who are dressing up as batman and are trying to take on the villains of the city themselves. but things are much worse when the joker waltzes into town, and he's going to bring hell upon gotham city. constantly playing with gotham's mind and trying to get batman to reveal himself, batman has never dealt with such a psychopathic genius before. the joker has named himself as the ""classy villain that gotham needs"", he also has brought a new thought into batman's head of them actually being more alike than different, that batman completes him, the joker would be nothing without him. but batman is relying on harvey dent, who is gotham's ""white knight"" trying to put all of gotham's scum in jail. but when the joker plays batman and commissioner gordon, harvey and rachel find themselves in very horrific position and harvey must discover if he will die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.all the performances are dead on in this movie, now everyone's going crazy over heath ledger's performance, but one performance i would also love to credit is aaron eckhart who plays harvey dent/two face, his performance was just as great as heath's and made two face a human villain. you could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened to him and why he became two face. i know that everyone is saying this but i truly mean when i say this is one of the best movies i have seen in a very long time. we had some great movies these past few years, but i think the dark knight is seriously something special, but i don't wanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater expecting my words to be the same as your own. in my opinion though this is not a great movie, i can't come up with a word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was, to be honest i would go above a 10 rating if i could; this is the batman film that we have been waiting for. i've seen it twice in one weekend, i'm going to see it three times this upcoming week, i don't mind one bit. i can't wait for the sequel and i would just like to say rip to heath, wish he could have seen his breath taking performance as the joker.10/10"

","i think that i could wax lyrical but this movie all day. it is absolutely incredible from start to finish.this is the batman trilogy's second outing. it's filled with hard-hitting action and almost every scene is absolutely enthralling to watch. the story is really good. the twists and turns keep the viewer constantly on their toes, especially in the third act of the movie. there are so many memorable scenes packed throughout this movie, so many quotes and ideas sprinkled throughout that you probably could analyze it for hours.because while the action and story is incredible, it is the dynamic between the batman and the joker that really makes this movie what it is. it is all in the contrast between the two. right against wrong. chaos and anarchy versus order. the joker is the perfect villain for batman. batman is literally, as said in the movie, a symbol. the very essence of the idea of the batman is centered around order, rules and moral codes. he is the embodyment of what is right. the joker challenges the very core and foundation of who batman is and what he stands for. he is someone who doesn't follow any rules. he is pure chaos and anarchy personified. as he so perfectly states in the third act of the movie, while hanging upside down off of a building: ""this is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object"". the joker wants the batman to go against his morals and to break his rules. the powerful thing is also that you can see why the joker does what he does. in some ways he has a point and that also adds another layer to the character and to the dynamic between the two. it is truly an amazing battle. the brilliant acting from heath ledger is a major part of it too. he is absolutely incredible as the joker. rest in peace.i could probably go on further about how great i think this movie is but i'll just say this. just watch the movie. you should watch the first movie of the trilogy first but if that is something you absolutely don't wan't to do i still think you should see this movie. it is just great."

","christopher nolan's second bundle of joy ""the dark knight"" exceeded all  of my expectations!!! with the success of 2005's reboot of the batman  franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it,  amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more  gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times  throughout. christian bale delves more deeper into batman, sworn to  fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if  his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his  fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. but with the  help of his trusted butler/ally alfred (played superbly by michael  cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. but  the real star of the show is heath ledger as batman's most deadly  enemy, the joker. i can honestly tell you that: as good as jack  nicholson was in batman'89 he is child's play compared to this joker.  he is sadistic, psychotic, and downright scarier and psychologically  disturbing than the previous incarnation of the clown prince of crime  and ledger gives it his all to do him justice. along with the original  cast comes some fresh faces such as aaron eckhart, maggie gyllenhaal  and more. i must say though i liked katie holmes, gyllenhaal gives a  much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress""  stereotype (though there's a little of it, thankfully) that's common in  films. bale and gyllenhall have much better chemistry this time around  more so than holmes. even better, the fight sequences are vastly  improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""begins""  in addition to new technology at batman's disposal.  also worth mentioning is screenwriter jonathan nolan, who gives the  film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.  simply put, the dark knight is totally more bad ass than ""begins."" the  action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. i applaud  christopher nolan, christian bale, and especially heath ledger (who  sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing  in mr. nolan's talents for this second installment. although some may  feel a bit of melancholy over ledger's death, but as a final note i  will say this sincerely from my heart: remember heath ledger and honor  him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a  human being and father to his daughter matilda  ledger. may we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his  daughter for years to come. remember . . . honor him not only for this  role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented  actor.  rest in peace. heath ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008."

","although i don't think it is the fourth best movie ever made, as it is rated according to imdb, i do think it stands head and shoulders above its super-hero peers, mainly because it is not a superhero movie. batman is a mere mortal with lots of time to train himself physically and money to design the nifty gadgets he uses.everybody on earth has seen this film, so no use regurgitating the plot. i think heath ledger's rendition of the joker is a masterpiece. every time he leaves the screen i keep waiting for him to come back. ledger should have won the best actor oscar rather than supporting actor, because this is really a two leading man film - bale as batman and ledger as the joker. i always liked jack nicholson's rendition of the joker in the 1989 film directed by tim burton, but ledger just blows nicholson's performance away. maybe it is because nicholson's joker had a past and an explanation for his behavior, maybe it is because, after all, nicholson's joker just seems to be the wild side of the real jack nicholson where heath ledger never steps out of character for the entire film. ledger's joker is like the devil decides to become incarnate, but unlike ray milland's devil in ""alias nick beal"" shows his true self - somebody who wants to break the spirits of people, to turn them on one another, to wantonly destroy property, people, whatever. that's reinforced when the police can find no name, no past, no prints, no dna, not even a label in his clothes when they arrest him. his past is a great big question mark. i like michael caine's alfred - it's good to have someone with relevant past combat and guerrilla experience be a wise father figure to wayne in this role rather than just a kindly museum piece. likewise, morgan freeman is pitch perfect as lucius and wayne's version of q - somebody who invents his gadgets and runs his business since this really is not where wayne's mind is, freeman gives the performance the perfect balance of humor, business acumen, and conscience. and finally i like the fact that rachel, bruce wayne's love interest, is not played by someone who is some unrealistic 10.5/10. she's a cute girl, but her attributes lie in her mind and her heart as well.the negatives - i think harvey's transformation into two face is a little too pat. i don't know why batman has a totally different voice from bruce wayne. is he doing that on purpose? and i think i found one editing error. gordon in the end talks about how hard it will be to cover up harvey/ two face's murders including ""two cops"". harvey let crooked cop ramirez live and just knocked her out. but if she had lived then gordon and batman's plan to cover up harvey's crimes would never have worked because she would have known what happened. so which scene was wrongly included/scripted? i'd recommend it as one of the better films made since the turn of the century that was also a blockbuster."

"1812","the dark knight","lonewolfandcub",2008-07-16,9," the dark knight is as good as everyone says and easily the best superhero film made
","i think the big question...or the question everyone actually cares about is this: is christopher nolan's follow up to the critically acclaimed 2005 film ""batman begins,"" the dark knight, as good as everyone is saying? quite simply, yes, yes it is. there is no doubt about it, one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. this is no ordinary superhero movie, this is a character and dialogue driven piece, not as action orientated as you might expect.i will not go into plot details, because there is a lot of it. however, a basic one sentence summary is: batman now has to face his most cunning and psychotic enemy, someone with no real motives...the joker. now that that is out of the way, i will start off with the actors (and boy, is there a lot to talk about). christian bale has done a tremendous job as our beloved caped crusader, with him already blowing everyone else out of water with ""batman begins."" bruce wayne has a flawed personality that hangs on the balance between righteousness and criminal. his perception of justice causes an emotional and personal shift, whether he is a wealthy businessman who fights crime in a gadget-riddled suit or just a normal man who is sick of all the scum in gotham city and decides to give the law-breakers a dose of their own medicine. because of this, and bale's tremendous acting, bruce wayne is justified, and we emphasise with bale's flawed hero more than any of the other actors. if there ever was an excellent batman, this is it. the theme of right and wrong is played well with his character here.of course, i am sure you all want know if heath ledger was that good. and i can safely say that he most definitely was. ledger's joker is not only the best, but is now the greatest superhero film villain ever. his performance is truly terrifying, chilling, brilliant; any synonyms of the previous adjectives. every scene he is in is stolen. the joker truly is batman's worst villain; cunning and psychotic, nothing quite matches his laugh and sinister makeup. if ledger nabs the oscar for best actor, i honestly will not be surprised. it is a true tragedy to see such a talented actor fall at such a young age...all the other actors cannot be forgotten, though. aaron eckhart has definitely proved himself previously (""thankyou for smoking"") as someone to watch out for. here, as harvey dent (and later two face) he is very powerful. all he wants is justice; to bring down every single criminal. eckhart is the definitive two face. maggie gyllenhaal as wayne and dent's love interest, rachel dawes is much better than katie holmes. gyllenhaal's performance has substance, i really cared for her and her future and she was terrific in every scene. michael caine can do no wrong, and as alfred pennyworth he provides some comical and emotional scenes. morgan freeman as lucius fox, although a limited role, does inject some sly humour and much needed morals into the story. finally, gary oldman's lt. james gordon is riveting. he at least needs a best supporting actor nomination for his performance as another crime-fighting hero who faces some challenging situations.wally pfister's cinematography is simply stunning. gotham has never looked so good, so big and deep. his wide shots purvey a dirty aura and contribute to the feel of the film. without it, it may not have been the same. another oscar worthy portion, the music! with hans zimmer and james newton howard at the helm, how could it go wrong? the score sets the mood in every scene, giving an epic and thrilling tone. during the action sequences it really ups the adrenaline. and on the topic of action, the dark knight succeeds in having the best fight sequences and car chases in a comic book adaptation yet. with no obvious or over-use of cgi, the explosions and accidents are the real deal. thrilling, edge of your seat and violent, this is brutally awesome stuff.nevertheless, none of this would be possible without christopher nolan, the man behind it all. pairing up with the writer (and brother) jonathon nolan, the darkest batman movie yet is the best, and the best so far this year. this does not feel like a comic book film, the dialogue and situations feel so realistic. and, it is the script that drives this film. the dialogue is very, very well written and is the centre of the conflict and the movie.it may be bold to say this, but this is the best superhero film of all time. there are others that are magnificent (""superman"" and ""x-men"" are two examples) but this is the most complex, the most dark and the most spectacular and epic of them all. see it for bale, for ledger, for the music, the action and for nolan's flawless direction.5/5 and the best film of 2008 so far!!"

","so it finally happened, a dc comics movie adaptation that out-marveled the marvel folks, and to such a degree that it might be quite a while before anything comes close to topping ""the dark knight"". this was the severely grim and gritty version of the batman, ushered in by frank miller's initial treatment in the landmark graphic novel ""the dark knight returns"" in 1986. miller's portrayal of the iconic super hero took the gloves off as far as politically correct behavior goes. the movie explores this theme at many levels, and would have served up enough of a plot to keep this viewer interested even without the explosions, chases and general mayhem that modern day audiences need to get their fix on. actually, the joker summed it all up quite brilliantly hanging upside down from one of batman's cables over the streets of gotham, as noted in my summary line above. in the comic book world, they have been fighting each other forever, or as long as forever exists since the creation of batman back in 1939; the joker came on the scene in 1940 in the comic, batman #1.i don't think this could have been the same picture without heath ledger in the role of batman's all time greatest nemesis. his portrayal blows away jack nicholson's performance in 1989's ""batman"", and that's through no fault of nicholson's. today's films are a product of harsher and deadlier times, and it's striking that ledger's characterization would define the joker as an extremist, perhaps even a terrorist. more than once i found myself questioning what was going on during the opening bank robbery scene. the bad guys were offing each other based on instructions delivered by the joker, and you suddenly come to the realization that this domino game had to end with one man standing. it's how we're introduced to ledger's definitive joker, a performance that won't be topped.another thought came to me as i watched the story unfold, and that was how similar the coin toss gimmick paralleled the one in ""no country for old men"". harvey dent (aaron eckhart) began using the tactic following the death of rachel dawes (maggie gyllenhaal), and i began picturing javier bardem in the role of the joker. hard to imagine who might have been the more evil character, bardem's anton chigurh in a more realistic setting, or the joker in a fictional gotham city. fortunately, not a choice one would normally have to consider.i'm a little bit on the fence as to christian bale's portrayal of the batman. he's more than adequate as bruce wayne, but the voice he gives to the dark knight seems a bit melodramatic. granted, he couldn't use the same voice as his alter ego, but there were times that it sounded so forced as to come across as parody, and other times just goofy, almost a throwback to the adam west days of the tv batman. strange, but have you considered that no one ever calls him the caped crusader anymore either?all in all, great performances all around. gary oldman's portrayal of the new commissioner gordon was excellent, while michael caine as alfred, and morgan freeman as lucius fox were solid even with limited screen time. i thought about katie holmes just once while making a mental comparison when maggie gyllenhaal first appeared on screen. truthfully, they looked similar enough to effect the transition smoothly to the point where it wasn't distracting for me in the least.obviously, the set up for the next sequel was firmly set in place with the creation of two face, the now alter ego of district attorney harvey dent. the rendering of dent's burned face was boldly executed and quite marvelous in it's own grotesque way. i'll be looking forward to the next installment.and now, for a personal rant. i probably should put this in parentheses because it doesn't have anything to do with the movie, but for this picture to be #1 on the imdb list of all time best movies after 4 days of release is incomprehensible, if not downright laughable (and i did rate it a 10 myself). i think there should be a moratorium of at least a couple of years before a film qualifies for imdb ranking, giving the dust some time to settle from all the grand opening hoopla that surrounds a picture like this. i feel the same way about other recent movies like ""no country for old men"" and ""there will be blood"", both of which garnered numerous awards and fan approval. but if they're to be considered among the best films of all time, they'll be considered that way a decade from now without the need for multiple votes from over zealous fan boys."

","(synopsis) bruce wayne/batman (christian bale) continues to eliminate crime in gotham city with the help of lt. jim gordon (gary oldman) and the new district attorney, harvey dent (aaron eckhart). the dark knight wants to finally get rid of organized crime for good and be free of their corruption. batman soon finds that a new psychopathic mastermind known as the joker (heath ledger) has taken over organized crime. the joker's plan is to terrify the citizens and throw the city into chaos, and kill batman. batman takes the fight with the joker personal, which makes him confront his own beliefs. the joker is the most dangerous criminal that batman has encountered, and he will need all his strength and vigilance to defeat him.(my comment) this film just blew me away. christian bale is a natural as bruce wayne/batman, and michael caine fits the part of alfred, the trusted butler. heath ledger's performance as the sadistic joker was absolutely disturbing and scary yet simply amazing. i would not want to meet the joker in a dark alley, and whatever you do, don't ask him how he got his smile, especially, when he has a knife in his hand. ledger's performance has turned the joker into a new iconic movie villain image. between all the punches, mayhem, and explosions, there is some good sinister dialog. the movie not only has a lot of action, it also tells the story of the internal struggle that bruce wayne is having with being the batman hero. bruce wayne wants to be himself and maintain the difference between himself and batman. bruce must decide to follow the code or do what has to be done without affecting his own morals. the movie explores the literary themes of hero verses villain, as well as order verses anarchy, and the joker explains to batman that to have one you must have the other, and because of that, they will always be connected. the movie is long, but it went by so fast. you will love the last 45 minutes, because of the non-stop action with batman in his new sonic suit and his batpod. with all the explosions, body count, and the dark mood of the movie, i don't think parents should take young children.

","batman has always been my favourite superhero ever since the first time i heard about him because he his human with no powers, also he is much more questionable than any other superhero. the story of the film is about batman, lieutenant james gordon, and new district attorney harvey dent beginning to succeed in rounding up the criminals that plague gotham city. they are unexpectedly challenged when a mysterious criminal mastermind known as the joker appears in gotham. batman's struggle against the joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to ""confront everything he believes"" and to improve his technology (which introduces the recreation of the batcycle, known as the batpod and the batsuit was redesigned) to stop the madman's campaign of destruction. during the course of the film, a love triangle develops between bruce wayne, dent and rachel dawes.there are now six batman films and i must say that the dark knight is the best out of all of them. the title is good because that is what batman actually is. it has been 3 years for the adventure to continue from batman begins but that entire wait was worth it. gotham city is very gothic looking and is very haunting and visionary. the whole movie is charged with pulse-pounding suspense, ingenious special effects and riveting performances from a first-rate cast especially from heath ledger who gave an oscar nomination performance for best supporting-actor. it is a shame that he can't see his terrific work on-screen. the cinematography is excellent which is made so dark & sinister that really did suit the mood for the film. usually sequels don't turn out to be better than the original but the dark knight is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original like the godfather 2. i also really liked the poster where the building is on fire in a bat symbol & batman is standing in front of it. christopher nolan is a brilliant director and his film memento is one of my most favourite films. he hasn't made 10 movies yet and 3 of them are already on the imdb top 250. overall the dark knight is the kind of movie that will make the audience cheer in the end instead of throwing fruit & vegetables on the screen."

","i used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what i saw that i would declare that movie to be the best of a series. after each of the prequel ""star wars"" films, i rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and i had a more well-rounded take. for that reason, i steer away from that mindset, and did for ""dark knight"".though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a warner bros. screening last night, ""dark knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""batman begins"". at a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. a delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of imax footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of gotham city.christian bale plays such a well rounded batman and bruce wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. i still have to remember that bale is british since he speaks with such a spot on american accent. bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for bruce wayne and threateningly for batman.countering him is the late heath ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy joker that i found it impossible to not have chills half the time i saw him on screen. what really separates this brand of joker from jack nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. it's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. how exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?initially, i was uneasy about how the character of harvey dent would be handled. in my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""batman"" animated series of the early 90s. as well as tommy lee jones could have handled him in ""batman forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. aaron eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the batman animated series.be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of gotham city that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. i can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the dark knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of gotham city's dark underside.""the dark knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars."

","i thought batman begins was a very well conceived and put together  movie. we finally get batman as a fully rendered character. we gain new  insight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in  his role as protector of gotham. we get to see gary oldman as an  honest-to-goodness good guy. and we get to see liam neeson conducting  perhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet.  but after seeing the dark knight, batman begins will forevermore be  viewed (by me at least) as a handy little prologue to a frickin'  masterpiece of a superhero film.  to say it's the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would  be akin to calling the nolan/ledger joker 'a bit eccentric'.  while watching it, i found myself thinking it was very long, which is  usually a sign that it's too long, and therefore boring. but that's not  actually the case here. the script is bulging with ideas, philosophical  musings, themes, which christopher nolan is not content to gloss over  in favour of cool set-pieces (as many comic adaptations are), but wants  to explore, wants to allow the characters to explore, at a logical  pace. so, what i guess i'm saying is, considering what it sets out to  do, the movie is long enough, while still constantly holding the  viewer's interest.  and that's not to say the thematic exploration comes at the expense of  big action, either. on the contrary, there is some truly awesome stuff  going on here. the chase with the truck, for example, is fantastic, and  there's some great hand-to-hand stuff too.  but what engages us most is the characters, and, while the script is  brilliant (the dialogue is sharp, and quite funny for the first  two-thirds, before the drama really kicks in), this mainly comes down  to the cast.  christian bale. taller than michael keaton was. more menacing than val  kilmer was. less like adam west than george clooney was. solid and  committed as always. he gives the character life, and actually makes us  feel for him. the word 'tortured' keeps coming to mind...and i suppose  it's pretty appropriate.  heath ledger. y'know, i'd heard talk of an oscar nomination, and  thought it sounded a bit dubious. a batman villain? winning an oscar?  is that what it's come to? then i thought, is it because he didn't get  one for brokeback? or more dubious still...is it because he...died?  but...well...how can i put it...?   it seems a bit blasphemous to compare jack nicholson to cesar romero,  but after seeing heath at work...jack (who once seemed so awesome) just  looks...well...lame.  if you've seen it, you hopefully get what i mean. if you haven't...you  need to. you will discover the true definition of commitment.  maggie gyllenhaal. i didn't have any problem with katie in the first  one (at the time), but i doubt she could have pulled off the more  emotional stuff rachel goes through here. seeing recasting was  necessary (does tom have a problem with his wife being involved with  batman? too many bad memories perhaps? why am i even talking about such  garbage here?) they could have done a butt-load worse than maggie. she  rocks.  as does aaron eckhart. but i'm not giving anything away. suffice it to  say my mind was blown...again. makes tommy lee jones look like...you  get the idea.  michael caine. still one of my favourite actors. alfred is the shiz.  morgan freeman. morgan freeman. aok.  gary oldman. as in bb, no mania. no psychosis. no nervous tics.  absolute subtlety. manages to hold his own alongside christian, heath  and aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. sign of spectacular  talent. go gaz.  eric roberts! william fichtner! michael jai white! tiny lister!  the whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful, well-executed  entertainment. it's equal parts cerebral and visceral. ideas and  action.  i've liked every batman movie so far (okay, besides batman & robin),  but this one makes them all look pretty bloody ordinary."

","well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. how was it? it was excellent. by far the best batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.everyone was waiting to see how well heath ledger performed as the joker in this film. he definitely deserves an oscar in his honor. the character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. compared to heath's other films like '10 things i hate about you' and even 'brokeback mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.the film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.during the film on the scene with batman against the joker, bike vs truck. people thought this was the ending. no, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, i guess that's why they called it the 'dark' knight as well as the relation to batman himself.the cast was great. with christopher nolan playing batman, good performance, heath ledger played extremely well, maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. michael caine and morgan freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. aaron eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing harvey/ two face's face in the many moods he displayed.great explosions made it entertaining. made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.this movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor heath ledger's life. (may he r.i.p) his performance made what this film is right now.i recommend this film for any action fan, especially a batman fan. or if your even a heath ledger fan. go ahead right now and see this film. it's great!"

","in an age when movie and tv franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (i'm looking at you, disney), i don't think anyone was expecting much from puss in boots: the last wish - certainly not i.after the first 5 minutes, i knew this was something special.firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from arkane and enter the spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. the 2d elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.the music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).the dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling i think i've ever seen. in a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. the cast do a great job of selling them too. goldi and the bears come out with brilliant british-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.and then there's the wolf. this character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. his style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, i'm serious).at a time when disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - dreamworks have taken on the mantle.it made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. you might think i'm overselling it, but hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.there are those that say that hollywood is done - i know i do. but dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

","you heard me! my wife and i just got back from the theater, and absolutely loved this movie, even more than any of the shrek movies and the first puss in boots!this movie has so much to love, from beautiful visuals/action to consistent humor that actually had us laughing to engaging characters, both old and new. such a fun time, and so worth seeing in the theaters, though we'll definitely be picking up a copy once it's out on dvd!without giving too much away, there are several different antagonists in this movie that scratch all the bad-guy itches, covering the spectrum from totally hateable to horrifying to relatable and sympathetic. a great cast! also, the magical world they came up with for this movie was awesome, with some really cool/unique features!at first, we were a little worried about the dog character, neither of us being big fans of daffy sidekicks, but we were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves rooting for him! he's hilarious, and that's coming from a cat-lover!several callbacks to the first puss in boots movie made this one feel less like a spin-off than a worthy standalone franchise, and the movie was packed with magical references that all ages will be able to recognize and enjoy.do yourself a favor and free a few hours for this one!! a rare 10 from me!!"

"1829","the dark knight","rgkarim",2022-12-22,8," a wish can come true! solid start to dreamworks redemption
","likes:pacing
-very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.adorable characters/feel
-new characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-the feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-has that element of shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.the animation
-it's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy dreamworks does so well.-the design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-the world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that i certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-and it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than disney for the blend of real and cartoons.the voice acting:
-many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that snl like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. he own the horner character and brought some of the best lines.-wagner moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the big-bad wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-pugh is okay, not my favorite role as goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. it does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-banderas takes boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the spanish stereotype. and yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.the references/jokes
-the stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of shrek.-it's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-the fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-it feels like the first two shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. again, refreshing that they were able to step back.the designs changes to an extent
-creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-like into the spiderverse? good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that puss does.-not overused, which is very good for me.the action at times
-shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-this movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-the ending fight shows the potential of what dreamworks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes i've seen this year.the heart
-lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-the movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-there are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. that's hard to do in many things.-i love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-have not felt this way since shrek 2.dislikes:the darkness
-it's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.predictable
-the lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-the movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.too many antagonists
-one of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-they do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.the comedy is still tapered
-it's starting to go back to shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made shrek, shrek.-they took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.the animation changes at times
-the animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-the comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.the action still not complete
--shrek and shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-this movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-the stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-they sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-often was shorter than i wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.the verdict
i must say, puss in boots: the last wish was a much better film than when i walked in. perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. it evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. and it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. this film is indeed a solid return to the world and i had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. however, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance i was looking for. the movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with puss in boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. and the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the shrek that we saw in the first two movies. still, i do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

"1831","the dark knight","wolfinflannel",2023-10-21,10," restored my faith in animated movies!
","puss and boots: the last wish was a true 'feel good' movie. the plot was well thought out and transitioned flawlessly from the last puss and boots film. what made this different from the previous movie is the mature theme and sentiments that made the film enjoyable and illuminating for all ages. the story progression was smooth and did not make the movie feel too short or too long. the story's theme (life is too short, so we must value what we have) flows through several different angles and characters throughout the story. the theme is not lost during the movie and is carried by the protagonist's emotions and personal growth. the characters in this movie helped express the theme and made the film more enjoyable. puss was the perfect protagonist, and his personal growth in the movie showed the audience that it is never too late for a fresh start, especially given that his character did not transition from the last film to the beginning of this one. kitty and pedrito's contrasting personalities and feelings allow two perspectives to get through to puss and show him what it means to be a family. goldy and the three bears added an extra obstacle for 'team friendship' but highlighted the theme through their growth. death was a great character because he was simply doing his job and was the character that indirectly pushed puss to become a better person and respected him for it. jack horner was an excellent antagonist because he was indeed a villain. instead of a character that was hurt by society or had good intentions deep down, this character was a pure monster. it was refreshing to have a villain that everyone could get behind disliking. the dialogue in this movie was powerful. each sentence helped tell the story, and it did not feel like there were any filler lines. the comic relief was natural, and the emotional conversations were deep. the imagery and background in the film were well articulated and detailed. each setting aligned with the active story and flowed with the transitions. the background music of the story was also fitting; it added an extra layer for the viewer and did not distract them from the story. this movie gave hope for the future of animated movies in america."

"1836","the dark knight","cinema-reviewer321",2023-01-08,10," the legendary puss in boots
","i have seen good movies in the year of 2022, but puss in boots: the last wish (2022) is by far the best animated movie of 2022 and is my favorite movie from that year. also, it is the best movie in the shrek franchise.the voice cast is great; antonio banderas as puss in boots was great, salma hayek was great, and harvey guill√©n as perrito was great because they are good characters, and they are funny. florence pugh as goldilocks, olivia colman as mama bear, ray winstone as papa bear, and samson kayo as baby bear were funny, and they were also good characters.there is this wolf villain in the movie that is legit creepy, was such a cool character. he does certain things that makes him a great villain for puss in boots to go against, and he is voiced by wagner moura who has a great voice for this character.the animation is beautiful in this movie; it has amazing action scenes, pretty scenery, and imaginable locations that look great in this animation style. the movie is also creative in how it uses fairytale locations and items from those stories, which is what makes another villain character voiced by john mulaney funny to watch.the movie has a simple plot but does it in a creative way with great characters, and some little references to shrek. what i especially loved was how puss in boots starts laughing in the face of danger, but because he is on his last life, he starts getting scared and starts thinking about what he has done with his earlier lives and how spent them.i had a fun time with puss in boots: the last wish (2022); it has fantastic animation, it was funny, it has great characters, it has great emotional moments, and there are great action scenes. i highly recommend checking this movie out because you will have gun with it, and i am excited to see this movie again when i get the chance."
"1837","the dark knight","jakebunker",2023-07-08,10," believe the hype
","this is the best animated feature since into the spider-verse, and probably better than toy story 4 and soul. i don't find many movies rewatchable nowadays and this is one of the few. not only is it a visual masterpiece (huge credit to the animators, well done!) but from a critical standpoint is has extremely well done characters, an engaging and relatable story, and takes very bold actions that will leave animation-lovers stunned for years to come. spoilers would be ruining an experience that you simply must witness for yourself, so what are you waiting for? believe the hype, go watch it if you haven't already! 9.5/10 but imma round up.edit: i've given it a year and came back to it and it's just even better the second viewing. in my opinion this is dreamwork's greatest movie (especially if you take away the first 5 minutes), better than kung fu panda, how to train your dragon, even prince of egypt. also the only dreamworks movie that i think deserves a 10/10. it's one thing to make an actually good and compelling story but to be also very entertaining and engaging for everyone is another feat. the user ratings and critics ratings are way too low. most criticisms of the movie are, imo, flawed, non-existent or biased. i sincerely cannot recommend this movie enough."
"1838","the dark knight","soumikbanerjee1996",2023-01-12,8," one darn good entertainer!
","this has caused quite a stir in recent days, and it's it safe to say that it eventually caught my interest. speaking for myself, i knew nothing about puss because i had never seen a single movie in the 'shrek' lineup, which sparked my curiosity even more.to prep for this allegedly wonderful sequel, i had to finish the first film first, which i did. i saw the first puss in boots movie this morning, but to my utter disappointment, it did not meet my expectations, and uncertainty worked its way in. i was worried about whether the sequel would live up to the hype.and i am pleased to report that it did. 'the last wish' may not be among the best films i have ever seen, but it is an interesting and enjoyable watch for sure.the visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the blend of two distinct animation art styles makes for an interesting cinematic experience, the score, too, sprinkled its fair share of magic, and on top of that, the characters are more fleshed out, unlike the last time, and the inclusion of 'perrito' and 'death' brought radical changes to the narrative, their mere presence made this more exciting."
"1839","the dark knight","jaredkjacoby",2023-02-07,10," love it!
","after losing his eighth life to a bell falling on top of him, puss in boots is down to his last life. an encounter from a vicious bounty hunter with a frightening presence destroys his confidence and for the first time, he feels fear. after escaping by the skin of his teeth, he decides he is no longer worthy of the name puss in boots and begins life as an adopted cat. he learns about the dark forest where someone can make a wish on the wishing star. with this in mind, the crafty feline returns to adventure to get his lives back.a little late to review this movie, but i still caught it in theaters. i knew from the trailer that this would be a cool movie. at first, i was wondering why dreamworks is creating another puss in boots movie. it feels weird to make a sequel to a spin-off that came out over a decade ago. as someone who has not watched the original puss in boots, i do not think you need to watch the original to get what is going on here aside from maybe puss' relationship with kitty softpaws. with that said, let me tell you how good this movie is!puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animated films. first of all, the animation looks absolutely stunning. the movie has probably the best animation from a cgi film i have ever seen. not only do the movement and expressions look smooth and crisp, the cinematography and imagery looks amazing and memorable too. there are many awesome shots in this film such as a shot of puss staring in the eyes of death. these shots strengthen the emotional moments and even some of the funny moments as well. every shot in this movie looks awesome. the animation really shows its fluidity in the action scenes. this movie has better action than 90% percent of the live-action blockbusters out there. the set pieces are so dynamic and entertaining that there is not a boring moment in the film. the opening set piece sets the tone for the entire movie and from that point forward, i knew i was in for a ride. the soundtrack is awesome too from the catchy score to the fun opening song for puss in boots.fantastic visuals aside, the story is memorable too. this movie pushes its pg rating. there is blood, cursing and dark themes that may frighten younger viewers. the story is about how puss is reacting to the idea that he is on deaths door. if he dies one more time, he will be gone forever. this is a movie where we see one of the coolest and most confident characters in animation lose his confidence. with that, he has a character arc that gives him depths and flaws that are relatable so even when he does something kind of selfish, you can still sympathize with his motivations. this movie has a lot of stylish action and funny jokes, but the scenes revolving around the wolf ramp up the dark tone of the movie. it never loses its sense of humor and this is one funny movie. i love the snarky dialogue, perrito gets one scene with goldilocks and the three bears that steals the show comedy wise. this movie has the perfect mix of comedy, action, drama and emotional moments to make it stand out.in addition to a great story, the cast of characters are memorable too. puss is at his best. he is the same awesome and adorable character from shrek, but he is given a lot of vulnerability here. he starts out as this arrogant, but powerful guy who can take down giants, but when he sees that death is coming for him, you can see how it shakes him to the core. his friends kitty softpaws and especially perrito are great characters too. perrito seems like the guy that would annoy everyone, but he is a great support character who is hilarious and just plain adorable. he is also surprisingly aware of emotions. there is one scene with him and puss that warmed my heart.as for the antagonists, the wolf is one of my favorite antagonists in an animated film. he has a badass voice, he completely changes the tone of the movie and he wipes out puss' bravado entirely and reduces him to a frightened cat. he is also a great fighter, but it is his presence, voice, dialogue and whistle that make him truly memorable. kids might have nightmares because of him. goldilocks and the three bears are fun anti-villains that have a sweet bond with each other. then there is the gluttonous scumbag jack horner. this is the character the writers decided to just make as hilariously hatable and disgusting as possible. they make no attempt to give this guy any sympathetic trait and i love it. we need more outright terrible people in new animated films. he is a funny villain with how unapologetic he is towards his minions, but you will be actively rooting for this character's demise.every single character in this film is memorable to a degree. it helps that the voice acting in this movie is excellent with antonio banderas as puss, salma hayek as kitty, harvey gull√©n as perrito, john mulaney as jack horner and especially wagner moura as the wolf. moura might have one of the best voices for a villain in animation i have seen in a while. each person brings their character to life in this movie. i can see any main character here being someone's favorite in the movie. that is how you know that you have a great cast.there is not a dull moment in this movie. puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animation and more. i did not expect a movie like this to be that great, but when i saw the trailers with the gorgeous animation, i knew this movie was going to be a ride. i did not expect it to become one of my favorite films of 2022, but it definitely. i really hope it wins best animated feature at the academy awards this year. dreamworks deserves this one. check it out as soon as you can."

"1851","the dark knight","jakebunker",2023-07-08,10," believe the hype
","this is the best animated feature since into the spider-verse, and probably better than toy story 4 and soul. i don't find many movies rewatchable nowadays and this is one of the few. not only is it a visual masterpiece (huge credit to the animators, well done!) but from a critical standpoint is has extremely well done characters, an engaging and relatable story, and takes very bold actions that will leave animation-lovers stunned for years to come. spoilers would be ruining an experience that you simply must witness for yourself, so what are you waiting for? believe the hype, go watch it if you haven't already! 9.5/10 but imma round up.edit: i've given it a year and came back to it and it's just even better the second viewing. in my opinion this is dreamwork's greatest movie (especially if you take away the first 5 minutes), better than kung fu panda, how to train your dragon, even prince of egypt. also the only dreamworks movie that i think deserves a 10/10. it's one thing to make an actually good and compelling story but to be also very entertaining and engaging for everyone is another feat. the user ratings and critics ratings are way too low. most criticisms of the movie are, imo, flawed, non-existent or biased. i sincerely cannot recommend this movie enough."
"1852","the dark knight","soumikbanerjee1996",2023-01-12,8," one darn good entertainer!
","this has caused quite a stir in recent days, and it's it safe to say that it eventually caught my interest. speaking for myself, i knew nothing about puss because i had never seen a single movie in the 'shrek' lineup, which sparked my curiosity even more.to prep for this allegedly wonderful sequel, i had to finish the first film first, which i did. i saw the first puss in boots movie this morning, but to my utter disappointment, it did not meet my expectations, and uncertainty worked its way in. i was worried about whether the sequel would live up to the hype.and i am pleased to report that it did. 'the last wish' may not be among the best films i have ever seen, but it is an interesting and enjoyable watch for sure.the visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the blend of two distinct animation art styles makes for an interesting cinematic experience, the score, too, sprinkled its fair share of magic, and on top of that, the characters are more fleshed out, unlike the last time, and the inclusion of 'perrito' and 'death' brought radical changes to the narrative, their mere presence made this more exciting."
"1853","the dark knight","jaredkjacoby",2023-02-07,10," love it!
","after losing his eighth life to a bell falling on top of him, puss in boots is down to his last life. an encounter from a vicious bounty hunter with a frightening presence destroys his confidence and for the first time, he feels fear. after escaping by the skin of his teeth, he decides he is no longer worthy of the name puss in boots and begins life as an adopted cat. he learns about the dark forest where someone can make a wish on the wishing star. with this in mind, the crafty feline returns to adventure to get his lives back.a little late to review this movie, but i still caught it in theaters. i knew from the trailer that this would be a cool movie. at first, i was wondering why dreamworks is creating another puss in boots movie. it feels weird to make a sequel to a spin-off that came out over a decade ago. as someone who has not watched the original puss in boots, i do not think you need to watch the original to get what is going on here aside from maybe puss' relationship with kitty softpaws. with that said, let me tell you how good this movie is!puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animated films. first of all, the animation looks absolutely stunning. the movie has probably the best animation from a cgi film i have ever seen. not only do the movement and expressions look smooth and crisp, the cinematography and imagery looks amazing and memorable too. there are many awesome shots in this film such as a shot of puss staring in the eyes of death. these shots strengthen the emotional moments and even some of the funny moments as well. every shot in this movie looks awesome. the animation really shows its fluidity in the action scenes. this movie has better action than 90% percent of the live-action blockbusters out there. the set pieces are so dynamic and entertaining that there is not a boring moment in the film. the opening set piece sets the tone for the entire movie and from that point forward, i knew i was in for a ride. the soundtrack is awesome too from the catchy score to the fun opening song for puss in boots.fantastic visuals aside, the story is memorable too. this movie pushes its pg rating. there is blood, cursing and dark themes that may frighten younger viewers. the story is about how puss is reacting to the idea that he is on deaths door. if he dies one more time, he will be gone forever. this is a movie where we see one of the coolest and most confident characters in animation lose his confidence. with that, he has a character arc that gives him depths and flaws that are relatable so even when he does something kind of selfish, you can still sympathize with his motivations. this movie has a lot of stylish action and funny jokes, but the scenes revolving around the wolf ramp up the dark tone of the movie. it never loses its sense of humor and this is one funny movie. i love the snarky dialogue, perrito gets one scene with goldilocks and the three bears that steals the show comedy wise. this movie has the perfect mix of comedy, action, drama and emotional moments to make it stand out.in addition to a great story, the cast of characters are memorable too. puss is at his best. he is the same awesome and adorable character from shrek, but he is given a lot of vulnerability here. he starts out as this arrogant, but powerful guy who can take down giants, but when he sees that death is coming for him, you can see how it shakes him to the core. his friends kitty softpaws and especially perrito are great characters too. perrito seems like the guy that would annoy everyone, but he is a great support character who is hilarious and just plain adorable. he is also surprisingly aware of emotions. there is one scene with him and puss that warmed my heart.as for the antagonists, the wolf is one of my favorite antagonists in an animated film. he has a badass voice, he completely changes the tone of the movie and he wipes out puss' bravado entirely and reduces him to a frightened cat. he is also a great fighter, but it is his presence, voice, dialogue and whistle that make him truly memorable. kids might have nightmares because of him. goldilocks and the three bears are fun anti-villains that have a sweet bond with each other. then there is the gluttonous scumbag jack horner. this is the character the writers decided to just make as hilariously hatable and disgusting as possible. they make no attempt to give this guy any sympathetic trait and i love it. we need more outright terrible people in new animated films. he is a funny villain with how unapologetic he is towards his minions, but you will be actively rooting for this character's demise.every single character in this film is memorable to a degree. it helps that the voice acting in this movie is excellent with antonio banderas as puss, salma hayek as kitty, harvey gull√©n as perrito, john mulaney as jack horner and especially wagner moura as the wolf. moura might have one of the best voices for a villain in animation i have seen in a while. each person brings their character to life in this movie. i can see any main character here being someone's favorite in the movie. that is how you know that you have a great cast.there is not a dull moment in this movie. puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animation and more. i did not expect a movie like this to be that great, but when i saw the trailers with the gorgeous animation, i knew this movie was going to be a ride. i did not expect it to become one of my favorite films of 2022, but it definitely. i really hope it wins best animated feature at the academy awards this year. dreamworks deserves this one. check it out as soon as you can."

","it may seem like puss in boots: the last wish pointless ridiculous film on the surface ..... but there is a lot to like about this animated dreamworks film; the movie delivers on several levels making it worth your time seeking out . i am praising the overall aesthetic. the animation is more advanced, the movie looked like it was a fairy tale painting. takes advantage of modern cg technologies lovingly paired with more traditional 2d techniques. in the opening, the film uses more hand-drawn techniques like your yesteryear cartoons . and as it progresses the technique harnessed new advancements in cg technology to reintroduce this fairy tale world in new and refreshing way.....it is quite the spectacle to witness and in 3d to boot !!! not the same old cg. in the animation, they actually took off motion blur so that it frames stutters . i have actually never seen animation technique like this before ! really made this fantastical hybrid.puss in boots: the last wish mashed up a spaghetti western with a fairy tale, so you get those beautiful western compositions and staging opportunities, but then you get these fantastical locations born out of your imagination.puss in boots discovers that his passion for adventure has taken its toll: he has burnt through eight of his nine lives. puss sets out on an epic journey to find the mythical last wish and restore his nine lives.and the movie is all brought to life with a cast full of oscar nominated and winner actors; it makes all the sense in the world when you've got an entire universe populated by iconic fairy tale characters like goldilocks (florence pugh), the three bears (olivia colman, ray winstone, and samson kayo), the big bad wolf (wagner moura), little jack horner (john mulaney), and even puss himself (antonio banderas).this is a ""must-see"" for all. there are so many takeaways. this movie kept me wanting more. it was great to see all the fairy tale characters in play wanting something they already possessed, needing to appreciate the moment--learning to be mindful of what we already have around us everyday. it's equal parts exciting and hilarious as well as earnest. puss in boots: the last wish mixes stunning animation with a poignant, surprisingly mature story . 8/10."

","i've been a fan of puss in boots ever since i saw the first movie in 2011. i love his charm, his wit, and his badassery. so when i heard that there was going to be a new puss in boots movie, i was beyond excited.ah, puss in boots, the last wish movie - a nostalgic journey that whisked me back to a time when my biggest concern was deciding between chocolate or vanilla ice cream. with its witty charm and swashbuckling feline hero, this film felt like a warm hug from my childhood, complete with a sprinkle of grown-up humor.as the screen came alive with the mischievous adventures of puss, i couldn't help but chuckle at his charismatic swagger. that confident strut and those pleading eyes - i must admit, i almost believed i could pull off wearing a hat like that without looking utterly ridiculous. almost.the tale unfolds with all the whimsy of a fairy tale, complete with a daring quest and an oh-so-noble motive - the last wish. now, i've never met a talking cat in real life (although i've had my suspicions about mr. whiskers next door), but puss's banter with his furry and cute companions had me in stitches. it's like the avengers, but with furballs. genius.puss in boots: the last wish did not disappoint. it was everything i wanted it to be and more. the animation was beautiful, the story was engaging, and the humor was on point. but what really made the movie for me was the heart.this movie is a love letter to puss in boots and his fans. it's a story about a cat who is coming to terms with his mortality. it's a story about friendship, love, and finding your purpose in life. and it's a story that will stay with me long after i've seen it.i'm not going to lie, there were a few moments when i teared up. but it was the good kind of tears. the kind of tears that come from being deeply moved by a story.if you're a fan of puss in boots, then you need to see this movie. it's a must-see for any fan of animation, adventure, or heartwarming stories."

"1875","the dark knight","oktay_tuna",2023-01-12,9," a strange comparison(with breaking bad) and then some
","in the shrek movies, puss in boots was a very likable character. i think it is safe to assume that most of the people who love shrek (specifically shrek 2) also enjoy seeing puss in boots. it is enjoyable to watch him, doesn't interfere much with the themes of movies but has funny scenes and great action. as i was thinking of these things, i realized something. he is just like saul goodman from breaking bad. saul goodman is a great character in breaking bad. he is great in scenes he is in and is so fun to watch but he isn't much of a character. then better call saul came and saul goodman (jimmy mcgill) became as complex as (if not more) walter. first puss in boots movie wasn't like that for puss. it was more of the same in shrek movies. this movie delivers the character puss in boots desperately needed and then some. his arc in this movie is amazing and in a perfect world, the script of this movie would get an adapted screenplay nomination at the oscars this year (considering the fact that the competition in the adapted screenplay category is nonexistent).death is an amazing villain. having shorter screen time than most characters makes him an even better character. again another comparison to better call saul, death is like lalo salamanca. lalo also doesn't have a big screen time in the six seasons of the show, but he is easily one of the most memorable characters. death is always there, back in the audience's mind, and just when you forget that he exists, he returns. his whistle, his charisma... brilliant!puss and kitty's storyline and conflict are very complex when you remember that this is an animated movie mostly targeted at kids. the themes of legacy, the meaning of life, and the fear of attachment are very refreshing to see in an animated movie again. the addition of perrito creates a great contrast between him and puss and i would even go further to say that it can even spark some philosophical discussions about which way to live is better for you. legacy or living a life where you are comfortable with your family.i loved the additions of the three bears and goldilocks. their storyline was also fairly interesting to see progress but its pacing could have been better, which makes them the weakest links of the film which is a d**n good weak link if you ask me. the character of jack horner. he has very funny moments and is very interesting to see a villain who is truly deeply villainous with no point of return in an animated movie. the conscience bug thing was also interesting to see unfold.the animation and action scenes are superb. especially the ones with death. death is so good that i can't believe it. there are many jokes that land, songs that are fun and most importantly the movie structurally works. it just works. with this many characters, with this many plotlines, with this many detours, you might think that it is impossible to tie this in a great package. but they do. when this movie is at its worst, it is decent but when it is at its best it is one of the best-animated movies, ever.where did this movie come from? i would have wanted to be a kid when i first watched this movie. i would have been scared but i would have loved it. then i would have watched it again, sometime. and then again. it would have created nostalgia and at my age today when i would have looked back i would have said, ""it is not the best-animated movie ever, but it is my favorite animated movie ever."" because it would have been. what more can i say?"
"1876","the dark knight","josemigu",2022-12-11,9," it's better than original
","puss in boots the last wish improves considerably on its predecessor, with spectacular animation and a plot worthy of the franchise.the animation looks incredible in the action and chase sequences, the effort put into the film is noticeable, the same applies to the soundtrack that perfectly accompanies every moment of the movie. antonio banderas performs a good performance giving emotional and funny moments.i am glad that dreamworks have rescued this project and have given it a facelift for this time, providing an entertaining movie for both children and adults.i love this movie and i can't wait for the moment to see it again."

","do you like anime, because i do, and by god is this the most anime-like american animated movie i've seen. the way it does smooth action and atmosphere as well as intricate character moments reminds me a lot of series i've watched with a lot more detail and time. not only do the messages and themes resonate, but the portrayals are done surprisingly well of things like anxiety, fear of death, etc etc. i know that animated children's movies can execute these well, but this takes it to another level for me while having exhilarating anime-like fight scenes. they're on another level for something out of dreamworks, compare it to the shrek scene where he's fighting some of farquad's goons and it's like night and day. anyways, give this a watch, one of the best animated films in a fat minute."

","it may seem like puss in boots: the last wish pointless ridiculous film on the surface ..... but there is a lot to like about this animated dreamworks film; the movie delivers on several levels making it worth your time seeking out . i am praising the overall aesthetic. the animation is more advanced, the movie looked like it was a fairy tale painting. takes advantage of modern cg technologies lovingly paired with more traditional 2d techniques. in the opening, the film uses more hand-drawn techniques like your yesteryear cartoons . and as it progresses the technique harnessed new advancements in cg technology to reintroduce this fairy tale world in new and refreshing way.....it is quite the spectacle to witness and in 3d to boot !!! not the same old cg. in the animation, they actually took off motion blur so that it frames stutters . i have actually never seen animation technique like this before ! really made this fantastical hybrid.puss in boots: the last wish mashed up a spaghetti western with a fairy tale, so you get those beautiful western compositions and staging opportunities, but then you get these fantastical locations born out of your imagination.puss in boots discovers that his passion for adventure has taken its toll: he has burnt through eight of his nine lives. puss sets out on an epic journey to find the mythical last wish and restore his nine lives.and the movie is all brought to life with a cast full of oscar nominated and winner actors; it makes all the sense in the world when you've got an entire universe populated by iconic fairy tale characters like goldilocks (florence pugh), the three bears (olivia colman, ray winstone, and samson kayo), the big bad wolf (wagner moura), little jack horner (john mulaney), and even puss himself (antonio banderas).this is a ""must-see"" for all. there are so many takeaways. this movie kept me wanting more. it was great to see all the fairy tale characters in play wanting something they already possessed, needing to appreciate the moment--learning to be mindful of what we already have around us everyday. it's equal parts exciting and hilarious as well as earnest. puss in boots: the last wish mixes stunning animation with a poignant, surprisingly mature story . 8/10."

","in the shrek movies, puss in boots was a very likable character. i think it is safe to assume that most of the people who love shrek (specifically shrek 2) also enjoy seeing puss in boots. it is enjoyable to watch him, doesn't interfere much with the themes of movies but has funny scenes and great action. as i was thinking of these things, i realized something. he is just like saul goodman from breaking bad. saul goodman is a great character in breaking bad. he is great in scenes he is in and is so fun to watch but he isn't much of a character. then better call saul came and saul goodman (jimmy mcgill) became as complex as (if not more) walter. first puss in boots movie wasn't like that for puss. it was more of the same in shrek movies. this movie delivers the character puss in boots desperately needed and then some. his arc in this movie is amazing and in a perfect world, the script of this movie would get an adapted screenplay nomination at the oscars this year (considering the fact that the competition in the adapted screenplay category is nonexistent).death is an amazing villain. having shorter screen time than most characters makes him an even better character. again another comparison to better call saul, death is like lalo salamanca. lalo also doesn't have a big screen time in the six seasons of the show, but he is easily one of the most memorable characters. death is always there, back in the audience's mind, and just when you forget that he exists, he returns. his whistle, his charisma... brilliant!puss and kitty's storyline and conflict are very complex when you remember that this is an animated movie mostly targeted at kids. the themes of legacy, the meaning of life, and the fear of attachment are very refreshing to see in an animated movie again. the addition of perrito creates a great contrast between him and puss and i would even go further to say that it can even spark some philosophical discussions about which way to live is better for you. legacy or living a life where you are comfortable with your family.i loved the additions of the three bears and goldilocks. their storyline was also fairly interesting to see progress but its pacing could have been better, which makes them the weakest links of the film which is a d**n good weak link if you ask me. the character of jack horner. he has very funny moments and is very interesting to see a villain who is truly deeply villainous with no point of return in an animated movie. the conscience bug thing was also interesting to see unfold.the animation and action scenes are superb. especially the ones with death. death is so good that i can't believe it. there are many jokes that land, songs that are fun and most importantly the movie structurally works. it just works. with this many characters, with this many plotlines, with this many detours, you might think that it is impossible to tie this in a great package. but they do. when this movie is at its worst, it is decent but when it is at its best it is one of the best-animated movies, ever.where did this movie come from? i would have wanted to be a kid when i first watched this movie. i would have been scared but i would have loved it. then i would have watched it again, sometime. and then again. it would have created nostalgia and at my age today when i would have looked back i would have said, ""it is not the best-animated movie ever, but it is my favorite animated movie ever."" because it would have been. what more can i say?"
"1895","the dark knight","parksiet",2022-12-28,7," a cute family friendly adventure!
","""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a fun adventure in the ""shrek"" universe! i gotta admit i have not seen the original film, and don't cherish the ""shrek"" films as much as many do... so i went into this with mild expectations. and honestly, i had a good time; it was cute! do i think it was as good as many other reviewers have suggested? no. but it was enjoyable, lighthearted fun that is perfect for families with kids! the voice cast was awesome, especially john mulaney and florence pugh as the villains, jack horner and goldilocks respectively. and of course antonio banderas as puss in boots is iconic as ever!the animation here was gorgeous too, honestly it was one of my favourite parts. i love that major studio animated movies are finally starting to take more risks with their animation style, moving away from the typical 3d cgi realism. you gotta respect ""spider-man: into the spider-verse"" for starting this trend and showing that different styles can work! i loved that this had a more watercolor, storybook illustration look to it, it really worked for the story and was employed in such creative ways! i would love to see the ""shrek"" movies take this on, but alas they seem to have established their own look. this movie just looked so cool, so distinct in its own style, it really felt like i was watching a story in a fairy tale world.now, of course i have to admit i didn't love this movie. something about it felt off to me, i couldn't seem to see where the acclaim was coming from. sure, it was fun, it was cute, and i enjoyed myself while watching, but i never felt like i truly connected with the film. the opening scene felt a little jumbled to me, rapidly going from a musical sequence, to comedy for kids, to an action scene and i wished it would've let me settle into the story a bit first. i get this is a movie primarily for kids, but with most animation they tend to make parts enjoyable for the parents and older audiences as well. i don't really feel that here - they tried with the themes and the deeper storyline - but it never actually worked in my eyes. everything felt very kid-focused, which isn't a bad thing, it just meant i wasn't the core audience and so it makes sense why i wouldn't enjoy it as much. i have to say, the kids in my theatre seemed to be having a blast! i'm sure this is a great movie for families with children, it just wasn't as good as i was told it would be.i think the movie tried to do a bit of what pixar is known for, the whole ""trying to be deep"" thing. the movie involves puss in boots coming to terms with death, and it seemed to be somewhat shallow, it never truly dove into this aspect of the story. instead, the storyline is very linear and somewhat dull where it is just about the characters traveling to their destination and the villains sometimes catching up and then combat ensuing. and the physical goal literally being the spiritual goal just makes the inevitable plot point of ""maybe i don't need the thing i wanted all long and it's the friends i made along the way that count"" seem all the more predictable. even puss' relationship with the side characters is unchallenging. although he is deeply flawed, his companions never seem to care about that and forgive him all the time. the chemistry of the characters was just nowhere as endearing as in ""shrek"". still the adventure was quite fun, i just didn't think the themes clicked as it felt like they were trying to be deep in a way that is not as organic and surprising as a film like pixar's ""up"", ""finding nemo"" or even dreamworks' ""how to train your dragon"".perhaps i am being too harsh, i feel like this review is sounding more negative than anything. i really did have fun with it, and overall would give it a thumbs up, it's an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half. the animation was really cool, the voice cast was great, and man i loved the little nods to the ""shrek"" movies even if i was never a huge fan of those. if nothing else, this movie did make me really hopeful for another ""shrek"" film. i do enjoy this fairy tale world and the creative animation they used to tell the story!"
"1896","the dark knight","jp_91",2022-12-12,7," a visual delight. a script that could have given more.
","""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a film whose animation is excellent, full of colorful and detailed scenes, but its script becomes tired in some scenes and even predictable, although its positive message on issues of personal relationships stands out. the characters are fun, highlighting goldilocks and the three bears. antonio banderas and salma hayek manage to entertain by lending their voices to the protagonists. puss in boots is a fun character but his story lacks more irreverence like in ""shrek"". the soundtrack perfectly recreates the essence of a fairy tale. ""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a visual delight with a passable script that could have been better."
"1897","the dark knight","adamlennard",2023-05-09,10," how is it this good?
","so the first movie was ok, nothing spectacular but not bad by any means, one of those you won't go out your way to watch but if it's on you'd sit and watch it. so i was quite shocked that it was getting a sequel further shocked when so many people saying how good it is, so i took my four year old and my god this is disney pixar levels of good. how is puss in boots 2 honestly one of all the time great animated films? well i'll try to explain first the animation style is beautiful and perfect for this movie and because it's a different style from the shrek universe movies it stands out. then there's the characters all the main cast are wonderfully voiced (especially the wolf) and their stories are all told so well and developed. big jack horner is one of the best movie villains for years no tragic backstory, no sympathetic qualities just evil for evils sake and loves being evil. i must also mention the wolf, this character may give younger kids nightmares but as they get older they'll appreciate how awesome he is. the music is beautiful too. i could go forever, i love this movie it is a masterpiece and a travesty it never won best animated movie at the oscar's but still i feel it's good enough love that it won't matter. the last thing i can see is a great movie makes you feel lots of different emotions and this does that ,you can laughing one minute to going aww, to crying to craping yourself in terror. this film is a masterpiece."
"1898","the dark knight","deltawdunn",2023-07-17,9," one of dreamworks' best
","movies like this are the perfect counter to those who hold kid's movies to low standards. while this movie does have style, it's not particularly unique in terms of its story. it's a rather standard journey with most of what you'd expect from an animated kids movie. comedy relief sidekick, expected love interest, an irredeemable villain, etc etc... however, it does all of these so well that the predictability didn't matter. i know puss won't die, but the scenes with death are still tense because i buy puss' fear. after a while i knew goldie's wish would be for a human family and that by the end she'd learn to appreciate her bear family, but that doesn't change that it's very well done. big jack horner is cartoonishly evil, but he's the funniest character, and there are other characters who are actually well-developed so it didn't really matter. it has good action, a great opener, and some cool editing choices. aside from the great visual style and the fact that it expertly juggles three villain factions, this movie is pretty basic, but still great.it's not perfect though. in particular, i think the section at mama luna's was pretty meh. honestly, i don't think i'd care if the movie wasn't so tight, but the character mama luna herself wasn't really relevant and considering the prevalence of these scenes in the trailer, i think this could've been studio interference. maybe not though, one shouldn't assume that anything bad in a movie is due to execs.regardless, this is a great movie, easily top 5 in dreamwork's catalog, and probably higher. it's either an 8/10 or 9/10, can't really decide."
"1899","the dark knight","jph-65157",2023-08-02,9," beautifully animated, cool action sequences, funny new/returning characters, and full of important life lessons.
","when i first heard about the last wish, and saw some of the trailers, i thought it was going to be a bit goofy and not as good as the first one (though seeing puss say ""no hablo ingl√©s"" to get out of talking to that dog made me chuckle) and the stylized animation looked cheap and kind of hurt my eyes and i wasn't that interested. however, once i saw a few clips of it, i thought it looked rather interesting and decided to give a shot.after i finally watched it, i have to admit it was actually very good and comparable to the first puss in boots movie and in some cases, even better. the premise was interesting, the animation actually was pretty good, the stylized animation actually worked out pretty well (especially for the action sequences), full of new characters that were funny and cool, and had some important life lessons for everyone to remember and use in their everyday lives.so i liked the premise because puss using up eight of his nine lives and trying to get to the last wish to gain them back while also battling a bunch of other characters who want the wish sets up a cool and interesting story that'll keep you hooked to see who actually gets the wish. you can kind of guess what will happen in the end, but you still want to see what happens regardless.the animation was pretty beautiful as well because although they did not use the realistic animation of the shrek movies or the first puss in boots movie, having it stylized and more comic book-like works out well here as it makes the movie look more vivid and gives you a more fairy tale vibe. plus, there were more details they could add to the characters and the scenery as well. also, as much it kind of looked cheap, the stylized animation worked out well for some of the action scenes and made them look pretty cool and graphic and added more suspense to the fight scenes between the good guys and the bad guys.the characters were also pretty cool as well. puss (once again voiced by antonio banderas) is just as funny, cool, and energetic as he always was in the previous films, kitty softpaws (once again voiced by selma hayek) adds some great humor and banter with puss once again in his mission, and the new characters were quite interesting too. perrito, the little dog (voiced by harvey guill√©n), is pretty funny and although plays the typical annoying sidekick, his role works out pretty well here as he helps puss and kitty. goldilocks and the three bears (voiced by florence pugh, olivia colman, ray winstone, and samson kayo) add some funny humor as well and their banter with each other is quite hilarious as well. big jack horner, one of the villains (voiced by john mulaney), is certainly devious and sarcastic, and his dark humor is ironically quite funny at times (i mean, if he's voiced by mulaney, then obviously it's going to be funny, due to his rather deadpan delivery of his lines).then there's the wolf (voiced by wagner moura), who serves as the other villain in this, but way darker and more sinister than jack horner. specifically, he is really the grim reaper who is after puss for him cheating death eight times and wants to take his last life as punishment, even though puss is still alive. now, when i say this character is dark, he--is--dark! like from his red eyes to his hooded figure to his low, slow, creepy sounding voice to his spine chilling/goosebump inducing whistling to his only intention of claiming puss' last life, this is a dark villain done right and probably one of the best ones in any dreamworks movie in a long time. heck, i was surprised the directors and writers made the wolf as dark as they did as it would certainly freak out some kids, and even some adults as well. at the same time though, i'll give them credit for really stepping it up here and making a very interesting and intimidating villain, as well as not making him a surprise villain too and you knew he was a villain from the beginning (the surprise villain trope has been used too much lately and it was nice to have the obvious villain trope come back once again in my opinion). i would say if you have kids, viewer discretion is advised for the wolf's scenes, but it's just a few scenes and it's not constantly.now for the themes, they were definitely important ones that i believe we all should consider in our daily lives. i won't try to spoil anything with them, but the themes presented in the last wish involve being happy with the family you grew up with even if they're not your biological family, being around people (and animals) that you can trust, and also, accepting that death is an inevitable thing, but that means living life to the fullest and enjoying every moment of it and do not waste it. again, not trying to spoil too much, but they were presented really well in the last wish that will definitely grasp your attention and might even get you thinking about how things are going with your life and might make you consider making some better changes for yourself.alright, so i know that was a lot to say here, but i just wanted to go over everything that i liked about the last wish. i know it's been out for a while now, but for those who haven't seen it yet, i'd recommend giving it a chance because it's definitely one of the better animated movies that have come out in recent years and it's one that i'm sure you'll love instantly once you watch it. it does have its serious moments, but it has a good blend of that and humor and some touching moments that hit you in the feels. lastly, if you're a fan of puss in boots, then seeing him in action once again will definitely satisfy your movie going needs.so if you have netflix, apple tv, or any other streaming service puss in boots: the last wish is on, go watch it!!!"

","it was a refreshing experience, this beautiful story tells you the importance of the one life we all got. after a long time, i watched a dreamworks animated movie. well, it tried to make a new animation style, taking inspiration from 'into the spider-verse' 2d effects but also not losing their original stylized 3d style, i like it.fairy tale and say what, a fun & life moral centric story focuses on puss's story, making him take life seriously and that's interesting. but the best part of the whole movie was, the antagonist, death... i mean hat's off to death's acting, dialogues, and animation, you can count him as one of the coldest villains on your list. his whistle literally is scary, it feels good to listen but the tone isolates, as if it's a warning that death is coming to you. he is the highlight of this movie. also, i personally, like the story of the side characters, goldi and bears, or probably i liked goldi's character design and character arc.i'll recommend if you looking for something fun and life refreshing story, then definitely check this out because i bet you will be impressed by death's presence in scenes."

","i absolutely looooved this movie! the character animations are just outstanding and i wish they would make more movies like this one. i certainly hope there is another sequel in the works.i think this might even be an improvement on the first one and i loved that one too. antonio banderas is just perfect as usual and salma hayek as his swashbuckling love interest adds extra spark. ""death"" in the form of the big bad wolf is just too dark and believable. i loved the tie-ins with other nursery rhyme characters and fairy tales. goldilocks and the three bears and little jack horner as the now adult baddie, big jack horner, who gets his ultimate comeuppance are excellent, plus a few others thrown in here and there. it was fun identifying them.the film was funny with a ""message"" without being cloying and over sentimental. kids might find some of it scary, perhaps, but i can't imagine my younger self not being thoroughly delighted with it!i actually can't remember when last i enjoyed a movie this much!"

","don't get me wrong, i liked the first movie a lot but i had issues with it. humpty dumpty is one of the most confusing and dumb villains ever in dreamworks history, and kitty didn't felt like her own character and she was rendered a bit pathetically. however fortunately the last wish doesn't have those problems. kitty actually felt like her own character with her own choices and the villain is a huge improvement over humpty dumpty. instead of the confusing story we got, death was excellent. he was absolutely terrifying and a fitting antagonist for puss for about death. but the overall villain was jack horner and just like any other good villains, he was actively threatening, and a good story to back it up. the first had great action but this had a great great action if you know what i mean. only the kung fu panda and spider verse movies beat this in action. i particularly liked the climactic final duel between puss and death, it's such a creative battle and colorful as well. speaking of colorful, it was a wise move to adopt to the comic style animation instead of rest of the shrek franchise with realistic 3d animation. and one more praise are the messages, the first barely had a message to begin with because the message was bogged down by the confusing plot involving humpty. however the message was well and clearly told during this film because of family trope. goldie ended up appreciating her current family and puss himself ended up appreciating his friends and kitty instead of glory and fame which is a pretty strong message.however i just have one complaint. wasn't kitty and puss madly in love at the end of the first movie? i felt like they did it all over again and puss's arch in the first 30mins was a bit confusing which holds it back from becoming my 2nd favorite dreamworks film and a 10/10

"1918","the dark knight","oktay_tuna",2023-01-12,9," a strange comparison(with breaking bad) and then some
","in the shrek movies, puss in boots was a very likable character. i think it is safe to assume that most of the people who love shrek (specifically shrek 2) also enjoy seeing puss in boots. it is enjoyable to watch him, doesn't interfere much with the themes of movies but has funny scenes and great action. as i was thinking of these things, i realized something. he is just like saul goodman from breaking bad. saul goodman is a great character in breaking bad. he is great in scenes he is in and is so fun to watch but he isn't much of a character. then better call saul came and saul goodman (jimmy mcgill) became as complex as (if not more) walter. first puss in boots movie wasn't like that for puss. it was more of the same in shrek movies. this movie delivers the character puss in boots desperately needed and then some. his arc in this movie is amazing and in a perfect world, the script of this movie would get an adapted screenplay nomination at the oscars this year (considering the fact that the competition in the adapted screenplay category is nonexistent).death is an amazing villain. having shorter screen time than most characters makes him an even better character. again another comparison to better call saul, death is like lalo salamanca. lalo also doesn't have a big screen time in the six seasons of the show, but he is easily one of the most memorable characters. death is always there, back in the audience's mind, and just when you forget that he exists, he returns. his whistle, his charisma... brilliant!puss and kitty's storyline and conflict are very complex when you remember that this is an animated movie mostly targeted at kids. the themes of legacy, the meaning of life, and the fear of attachment are very refreshing to see in an animated movie again. the addition of perrito creates a great contrast between him and puss and i would even go further to say that it can even spark some philosophical discussions about which way to live is better for you. legacy or living a life where you are comfortable with your family.i loved the additions of the three bears and goldilocks. their storyline was also fairly interesting to see progress but its pacing could have been better, which makes them the weakest links of the film which is a d**n good weak link if you ask me. the character of jack horner. he has very funny moments and is very interesting to see a villain who is truly deeply villainous with no point of return in an animated movie. the conscience bug thing was also interesting to see unfold.the animation and action scenes are superb. especially the ones with death. death is so good that i can't believe it. there are many jokes that land, songs that are fun and most importantly the movie structurally works. it just works. with this many characters, with this many plotlines, with this many detours, you might think that it is impossible to tie this in a great package. but they do. when this movie is at its worst, it is decent but when it is at its best it is one of the best-animated movies, ever.where did this movie come from? i would have wanted to be a kid when i first watched this movie. i would have been scared but i would have loved it. then i would have watched it again, sometime. and then again. it would have created nostalgia and at my age today when i would have looked back i would have said, ""it is not the best-animated movie ever, but it is my favorite animated movie ever."" because it would have been. what more can i say?"
"1919","the dark knight","parksiet",2022-12-28,7," a cute family friendly adventure!
","""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a fun adventure in the ""shrek"" universe! i gotta admit i have not seen the original film, and don't cherish the ""shrek"" films as much as many do... so i went into this with mild expectations. and honestly, i had a good time; it was cute! do i think it was as good as many other reviewers have suggested? no. but it was enjoyable, lighthearted fun that is perfect for families with kids! the voice cast was awesome, especially john mulaney and florence pugh as the villains, jack horner and goldilocks respectively. and of course antonio banderas as puss in boots is iconic as ever!the animation here was gorgeous too, honestly it was one of my favourite parts. i love that major studio animated movies are finally starting to take more risks with their animation style, moving away from the typical 3d cgi realism. you gotta respect ""spider-man: into the spider-verse"" for starting this trend and showing that different styles can work! i loved that this had a more watercolor, storybook illustration look to it, it really worked for the story and was employed in such creative ways! i would love to see the ""shrek"" movies take this on, but alas they seem to have established their own look. this movie just looked so cool, so distinct in its own style, it really felt like i was watching a story in a fairy tale world.now, of course i have to admit i didn't love this movie. something about it felt off to me, i couldn't seem to see where the acclaim was coming from. sure, it was fun, it was cute, and i enjoyed myself while watching, but i never felt like i truly connected with the film. the opening scene felt a little jumbled to me, rapidly going from a musical sequence, to comedy for kids, to an action scene and i wished it would've let me settle into the story a bit first. i get this is a movie primarily for kids, but with most animation they tend to make parts enjoyable for the parents and older audiences as well. i don't really feel that here - they tried with the themes and the deeper storyline - but it never actually worked in my eyes. everything felt very kid-focused, which isn't a bad thing, it just meant i wasn't the core audience and so it makes sense why i wouldn't enjoy it as much. i have to say, the kids in my theatre seemed to be having a blast! i'm sure this is a great movie for families with children, it just wasn't as good as i was told it would be.i think the movie tried to do a bit of what pixar is known for, the whole ""trying to be deep"" thing. the movie involves puss in boots coming to terms with death, and it seemed to be somewhat shallow, it never truly dove into this aspect of the story. instead, the storyline is very linear and somewhat dull where it is just about the characters traveling to their destination and the villains sometimes catching up and then combat ensuing. and the physical goal literally being the spiritual goal just makes the inevitable plot point of ""maybe i don't need the thing i wanted all long and it's the friends i made along the way that count"" seem all the more predictable. even puss' relationship with the side characters is unchallenging. although he is deeply flawed, his companions never seem to care about that and forgive him all the time. the chemistry of the characters was just nowhere as endearing as in ""shrek"". still the adventure was quite fun, i just didn't think the themes clicked as it felt like they were trying to be deep in a way that is not as organic and surprising as a film like pixar's ""up"", ""finding nemo"" or even dreamworks' ""how to train your dragon"".perhaps i am being too harsh, i feel like this review is sounding more negative than anything. i really did have fun with it, and overall would give it a thumbs up, it's an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half. the animation was really cool, the voice cast was great, and man i loved the little nods to the ""shrek"" movies even if i was never a huge fan of those. if nothing else, this movie did make me really hopeful for another ""shrek"" film. i do enjoy this fairy tale world and the creative animation they used to tell the story!"
"1920","the dark knight","jp_91",2022-12-12,7," a visual delight. a script that could have given more.
","""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a film whose animation is excellent, full of colorful and detailed scenes, but its script becomes tired in some scenes and even predictable, although its positive message on issues of personal relationships stands out. the characters are fun, highlighting goldilocks and the three bears. antonio banderas and salma hayek manage to entertain by lending their voices to the protagonists. puss in boots is a fun character but his story lacks more irreverence like in ""shrek"". the soundtrack perfectly recreates the essence of a fairy tale.

"1921","the dark knight","adamlennard",2023-05-09,10," how is it this good?
","so the first movie was ok, nothing spectacular but not bad by any means, one of those you won't go out your way to watch but if it's on you'd sit and watch it. so i was quite shocked that it was getting a sequel further shocked when so many people saying how good it is, so i took my four year old and my god this is disney pixar levels of good. how is puss in boots 2 honestly one of all the time great animated films? well i'll try to explain first the animation style is beautiful and perfect for this movie and because it's a different style from the shrek universe movies it stands out. then there's the characters all the main cast are wonderfully voiced (especially the wolf) and their stories are all told so well and developed. big jack horner is one of the best movie villains for years no tragic backstory, no sympathetic qualities just evil for evils sake and loves being evil. i must also mention the wolf, this character may give younger kids nightmares but as they get older they'll appreciate how awesome he is. the music is beautiful too. i could go forever, i love this movie it is a masterpiece and a travesty it never won best animated movie at the oscar's but still i feel it's good enough love that it won't matter. the last thing i can see is a great movie makes you feel lots of different emotions and this does that ,you can laughing one minute to going aww, to crying to craping yourself in terror. this film is a masterpiece."
"1922","the dark knight","deltawdunn",2023-07-17,9," one of dreamworks' best
","movies like this are the perfect counter to those who hold kid's movies to low standards. while this movie does have style, it's not particularly unique in terms of its story. it's a rather standard journey with most of what you'd expect from an animated kids movie. comedy relief sidekick, expected love interest, an irredeemable villain, etc etc... however, it does all of these so well that the predictability didn't matter. i know puss won't die, but the scenes with death are still tense because i buy puss' fear. after a while i knew goldie's wish would be for a human family and that by the end she'd learn to appreciate her bear family, but that doesn't change that it's very well done. big jack horner is cartoonishly evil, but he's the funniest character, and there are other characters who are actually well-developed so it didn't really matter. it has good action, a great opener, and some cool editing choices. aside from the great visual style and the fact that it expertly juggles three villain factions, this movie is pretty basic, but still great.it's not perfect though. in particular, i think the section at mama luna's was pretty meh. honestly, i don't think i'd care if the movie wasn't so tight, but the character mama luna herself wasn't really relevant and considering the prevalence of these scenes in the trailer, i think this could've been studio interference. maybe not though, one shouldn't assume that anything bad in a movie is due to execs.regardless, this is a great movie, easily top 5 in dreamwork's catalog, and probably higher. it's either an 8/10 or 9/10, can't really decide."
"1923","the dark knight","jph-65157",2023-08-02,9," beautifully animated, cool action sequences, funny new/returning characters, and full of important life lessons.
","when i first heard about the last wish, and saw some of the trailers, i thought it was going to be a bit goofy and not as good as the first one (though seeing puss say ""no hablo ingl√©s"" to get out of talking to that dog made me chuckle) and the stylized animation looked cheap and kind of hurt my eyes and i wasn't that interested. however, once i saw a few clips of it, i thought it looked rather interesting and decided to give a shot.after i finally watched it, i have to admit it was actually very good and comparable to the first puss in boots movie and in some cases, even better. the premise was interesting, the animation actually was pretty good, the stylized animation actually worked out pretty well (especially for the action sequences), full of new characters that were funny and cool, and had some important life lessons for everyone to remember and use in their everyday lives.so i liked the premise because puss using up eight of his nine lives and trying to get to the last wish to gain them back while also battling a bunch of other characters who want the wish sets up a cool and interesting story that'll keep you hooked to see who actually gets the wish. you can kind of guess what will happen in the end, but you still want to see what happens regardless.the animation was pretty beautiful as well because although they did not use the realistic animation of the shrek movies or the first puss in boots movie, having it stylized and more comic book-like works out well here as it makes the movie look more vivid and gives you a more fairy tale vibe. plus, there were more details they could add to the characters and the scenery as well. also, as much it kind of looked cheap, the stylized animation worked out well for some of the action scenes and made them look pretty cool and graphic and added more suspense to the fight scenes between the good guys and the bad guys.the characters were also pretty cool as well. puss (once again voiced by antonio banderas) is just as funny, cool, and energetic as he always was in the previous films, kitty softpaws (once again voiced by selma hayek) adds some great humor and banter with puss once again in his mission, and the new characters were quite interesting too. perrito, the little dog (voiced by harvey guill√©n), is pretty funny and although plays the typical annoying sidekick, his role works out pretty well here as he helps puss and kitty. goldilocks and the three bears (voiced by florence pugh, olivia colman, ray winstone, and samson kayo) add some funny humor as well and their banter with each other is quite hilarious as well. big jack horner, one of the villains (voiced by john mulaney), is certainly devious and sarcastic, and his dark humor is ironically quite funny at times (i mean, if he's voiced by mulaney, then obviously it's going to be funny, due to his rather deadpan delivery of his lines).then there's the wolf (voiced by wagner moura), who serves as the other villain in this, but way darker and more sinister than jack horner. specifically, he is really the grim reaper who is after puss for him cheating death eight times and wants to take his last life as punishment, even though puss is still alive. now, when i say this character is dark, he--is--dark! like from his red eyes to his hooded figure to his low, slow, creepy sounding voice to his spine chilling/goosebump inducing whistling to his only intention of claiming puss' last life, this is a dark villain done right and probably one of the best ones in any dreamworks movie in a long time. heck, i was surprised the directors and writers made the wolf as dark as they did as it would certainly freak out some kids, and even some adults as well. at the same time though, i'll give them credit for really stepping it up here and making a very interesting and intimidating villain, as well as not making him a surprise villain too and you knew he was a villain from the beginning (the surprise villain trope has been used too much lately and it was nice to have the obvious villain trope come back once again in my opinion). i would say if you have kids, viewer discretion is advised for the wolf's scenes, but it's just a few scenes and it's not constantly.now for the themes, they were definitely important ones that i believe we all should consider in our daily lives. i won't try to spoil anything with them, but the themes presented in the last wish involve being happy with the family you grew up with even if they're not your biological family, being around people (and animals) that you can trust, and also, accepting that death is an inevitable thing, but that means living life to the fullest and enjoying every moment of it and do not waste it. again, not trying to spoil too much, but they were presented really well in the last wish that will definitely grasp your attention and might even get you thinking about how things are going with your life and might make you consider making some better changes for yourself.alright, so i know that was a lot to say here, but i just wanted to go over everything that i liked about the last wish. i know it's been out for a while now, but for those who haven't seen it yet, i'd recommend giving it a chance because it's definitely one of the better animated movies that have come out in recent years and it's one that i'm sure you'll love instantly once you watch it. it does have its serious moments, but it has a good blend of that and humor and some touching moments that hit you in the feels. lastly, if you're a fan of puss in boots, then seeing him in action once again will definitely satisfy your movie going needs.so if you have netflix, apple tv, or any other streaming service puss in boots: the last wish is on, go watch it!!!"

","it may seem like puss in boots: the last wish pointless ridiculous film on the surface ..... but there is a lot to like about this animated dreamworks film; the movie delivers on several levels making it worth your time seeking out . i am praising the overall aesthetic. the animation is more advanced, the movie looked like it was a fairy tale painting. takes advantage of modern cg technologies lovingly paired with more traditional 2d techniques. in the opening, the film uses more hand-drawn techniques like your yesteryear cartoons . and as it progresses the technique harnessed new advancements in cg technology to reintroduce this fairy tale world in new and refreshing way.....it is quite the spectacle to witness and in 3d to boot !!! not the same old cg. in the animation, they actually took off motion blur so that it frames stutters . i have actually never seen animation technique like this before ! really made this fantastical hybrid.puss in boots: the last wish mashed up a spaghetti western with a fairy tale, so you get those beautiful western compositions and staging opportunities, but then you get these fantastical locations born out of your imagination.puss in boots discovers that his passion for adventure has taken its toll: he has burnt through eight of his nine lives. puss sets out on an epic journey to find the mythical last wish and restore his nine lives.and the movie is all brought to life with a cast full of oscar nominated and winner actors; it makes all the sense in the world when you've got an entire universe populated by iconic fairy tale characters like goldilocks (florence pugh), the three bears (olivia colman, ray winstone, and samson kayo), the big bad wolf (wagner moura), little jack horner (john mulaney), and even puss himself (antonio banderas).this is a ""must-see"" for all. there are so many takeaways. this movie kept me wanting more. it was great to see all the fairy tale characters in play wanting something they already possessed, needing to appreciate the moment--learning to be mindful of what we already have around us everyday. it's equal parts exciting and hilarious as well as earnest. puss in boots: the last wish mixes stunning animation with a poignant, surprisingly mature story . 8/10."

","this movie... is the best movie that came out in 2022! where to begin?animation: the animation is brilliant and fantastic, with robust movements and amazing lighting. the combination of 3d movements and 2d swift animations is a truly robust combination that i personally loved. some scenes have truly stunning animations.storyline: the storyline is absolutely brilliant. there are no words to describe how amazing it is. if i explained anything, i would be spoiling the fantastic story here and there. you will get hooked into the movie in 10 minutes. very hooked, wanting to know whatever happens next.characters: very nice characters, amazing how they all interact with each other- especially puss's sidekick: perrito, a small cute dog. and also, get ready to meet the greatest fiction villain in this movie.the only drawbacks i have is that the trip to the dark forest at the beginning is a bit rushed, and the lead-up to the end is also very rushed. but the characters and combinations of everything (watch out for the wolf) really makes this movie worthwhile- definitely top 5 best movies i have ever seen.the wolf is the best character i've seen in a decade across the movie-verse.your last wish should be to watch this movie! it's pure amazing. :)"

","i absolutely looooved this movie! the character animations are just outstanding and i wish they would make more movies like this one. i certainly hope there is another sequel in the works.i think this might even be an improvement on the first one and i loved that one too. antonio banderas is just perfect as usual and salma hayek as his swashbuckling love interest adds extra spark. ""death"" in the form of the big bad wolf is just too dark and believable. i loved the tie-ins with other nursery rhyme characters and fairy tales. goldilocks and the three bears and little jack horner as the now adult baddie, big jack horner, who gets his ultimate comeuppance are excellent, plus a few others thrown in here and there. it was fun identifying them.the film was funny with a ""message"" without being cloying and over sentimental. kids might find some of it scary, perhaps, but i can't imagine my younger self not being thoroughly delighted with it!i actually can't remember when last i enjoyed a movie this much!"

","don't get me wrong, i liked the first movie a lot but i had issues with it. humpty dumpty is one of the most confusing and dumb villains ever in dreamworks history, and kitty didn't felt like her own character and she was rendered a bit pathetically. however fortunately the last wish doesn't have those problems. kitty actually felt like her own character with her own choices and the villain is a huge improvement over humpty dumpty. instead of the confusing story we got, death was excellent. he was absolutely terrifying and a fitting antagonist for puss for about death. but the overall villain was jack horner and just like any other good villains, he was actively threatening, and a good story to back it up. the first had great action but this had a great great action if you know what i mean. only the kung fu panda and spider verse movies beat this in action. i particularly liked the climactic final duel between puss and death, it's such a creative battle and colorful as well. speaking of colorful, it was a wise move to adopt to the comic style animation instead of rest of the shrek franchise with realistic 3d animation. and one more praise are the messages, the first barely had a message to begin with because the message was bogged down by the confusing plot involving humpty. however the message was well and clearly told during this film because of family trope. goldie ended up appreciating her current family and puss himself ended up appreciating his friends and kitty instead of glory and fame which is a pretty strong message.however i just have one complaint. wasn't kitty and puss madly in love at the end of the first movie? i felt like they did it all over again and puss's arch in the first 30mins was a bit confusing which holds it back from becoming my 2nd favorite dreamworks film and a 10/10

the first movie's score: 8.4/10."
"1939","the dark knight","oktay_tuna",2023-01-12,9," a strange comparison(with breaking bad) and then some
","in the shrek movies, puss in boots was a very likable character. i think it is safe to assume that most of the people who love shrek (specifically shrek 2) also enjoy seeing puss in boots. it is enjoyable to watch him, doesn't interfere much with the themes of movies but has funny scenes and great action. as i was thinking of these things, i realized something. he is just like saul goodman from breaking bad. saul goodman is a great character in breaking bad. he is great in scenes he is in and is so fun to watch but he isn't much of a character. then better call saul came and saul goodman (jimmy mcgill) became as complex as (if not more) walter. first puss in boots movie wasn't like that for puss. it was more of the same in shrek movies. this movie delivers the character puss in boots desperately needed and then some. his arc in this movie is amazing and in a perfect world, the script of this movie would get an adapted screenplay nomination at the oscars this year (considering the fact that the competition in the adapted screenplay category is nonexistent).death is an amazing villain. having shorter screen time than most characters makes him an even better character. again another comparison to better call saul, death is like lalo salamanca. lalo also doesn't have a big screen time in the six seasons of the show, but he is easily one of the most memorable characters. death is always there, back in the audience's mind, and just when you forget that he exists, he returns. his whistle, his charisma... brilliant!puss and kitty's storyline and conflict are very complex when you remember that this is an animated movie mostly targeted at kids. the themes of legacy, the meaning of life, and the fear of attachment are very refreshing to see in an animated movie again. the addition of perrito creates a great contrast between him and puss and i would even go further to say that it can even spark some philosophical discussions about which way to live is better for you. legacy or living a life where you are comfortable with your family.i loved the additions of the three bears and goldilocks. their storyline was also fairly interesting to see progress but its pacing could have been better, which makes them the weakest links of the film which is a d**n good weak link if you ask me. the character of jack horner. he has very funny moments and is very interesting to see a villain who is truly deeply villainous with no point of return in an animated movie. the conscience bug thing was also interesting to see unfold.the animation and action scenes are superb. especially the ones with death. death is so good that i can't believe it. there are many jokes that land, songs that are fun and most importantly the movie structurally works. it just works. with this many characters, with this many plotlines, with this many detours, you might think that it is impossible to tie this in a great package. but they do. when this movie is at its worst, it is decent but when it is at its best it is one of the best-animated movies, ever.where did this movie come from? i would have wanted to be a kid when i first watched this movie. i would have been scared but i would have loved it. then i would have watched it again, sometime. and then again. it would have created nostalgia and at my age today when i would have looked back i would have said, ""it is not the best-animated movie ever, but it is my favorite animated movie ever."" because it would have been. what more can i say?"
"1940","the dark knight","parksiet",2022-12-28,7," a cute family friendly adventure!
","""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a fun adventure in the ""shrek"" universe! i gotta admit i have not seen the original film, and don't cherish the ""shrek"" films as much as many do... so i went into this with mild expectations. and honestly, i had a good time; it was cute! do i think it was as good as many other reviewers have suggested? no. but it was enjoyable, lighthearted fun that is perfect for families with kids! the voice cast was awesome, especially john mulaney and florence pugh as the villains, jack horner and goldilocks respectively. and of course antonio banderas as puss in boots is iconic as ever!the animation here was gorgeous too, honestly it was one of my favourite parts. i love that major studio animated movies are finally starting to take more risks with their animation style, moving away from the typical 3d cgi realism. you gotta respect ""spider-man: into the spider-verse"" for starting this trend and showing that different styles can work! i loved that this had a more watercolor, storybook illustration look to it, it really worked for the story and was employed in such creative ways! i would love to see the ""shrek"" movies take this on, but alas they seem to have established their own look. this movie just looked so cool, so distinct in its own style, it really felt like i was watching a story in a fairy tale world.now, of course i have to admit i didn't love this movie. something about it felt off to me, i couldn't seem to see where the acclaim was coming from. sure, it was fun, it was cute, and i enjoyed myself while watching, but i never felt like i truly connected with the film. the opening scene felt a little jumbled to me, rapidly going from a musical sequence, to comedy for kids, to an action scene and i wished it would've let me settle into the story a bit first. i get this is a movie primarily for kids, but with most animation they tend to make parts enjoyable for the parents and older audiences as well. i don't really feel that here - they tried with the themes and the deeper storyline - but it never actually worked in my eyes. everything felt very kid-focused, which isn't a bad thing, it just meant i wasn't the core audience and so it makes sense why i wouldn't enjoy it as much. i have to say, the kids in my theatre seemed to be having a blast! i'm sure this is a great movie for families with children, it just wasn't as good as i was told it would be.i think the movie tried to do a bit of what pixar is known for, the whole ""trying to be deep"" thing. the movie involves puss in boots coming to terms with death, and it seemed to be somewhat shallow, it never truly dove into this aspect of the story. instead, the storyline is very linear and somewhat dull where it is just about the characters traveling to their destination and the villains sometimes catching up and then combat ensuing. and the physical goal literally being the spiritual goal just makes the inevitable plot point of ""maybe i don't need the thing i wanted all long and it's the friends i made along the way that count"" seem all the more predictable. even puss' relationship with the side characters is unchallenging. although he is deeply flawed, his companions never seem to care about that and forgive him all the time. the chemistry of the characters was just nowhere as endearing as in ""shrek"". still the adventure was quite fun, i just didn't think the themes clicked as it felt like they were trying to be deep in a way that is not as organic and surprising as a film like pixar's ""up"", ""finding nemo"" or even dreamworks' ""how to train your dragon"".perhaps i am being too harsh, i feel like this review is sounding more negative than anything. i really did have fun with it, and overall would give it a thumbs up, it's an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half. the animation was really cool, the voice cast was great, and man i loved the little nods to the ""shrek"" movies even if i was never a huge fan of those. if nothing else, this movie did make me really hopeful for another ""shrek"" film. i do enjoy this fairy tale world and the creative animation they used to tell the story!"
"1941","the dark knight","jp_91",2022-12-12,7," a visual delight. a script that could have given more.
","""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a film whose animation is excellent, full of colorful and detailed scenes, but its script becomes tired in some scenes and even predictable, although its positive message on issues of personal relationships stands out. the characters are fun, highlighting goldilocks and the three bears. antonio banderas and salma hayek manage to entertain by lending their voices to the protagonists. puss in boots is a fun character but his story lacks more irreverence like in ""shrek"". the soundtrack perfectly recreates the essence of a fairy tale. ""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a visual delight with a passable script that could have been better."
"1942","the dark knight","adamlennard",2023-05-09,10," how is it this good?
","so the first movie was ok, nothing spectacular but not bad by any means, one of those you won't go out your way to watch but if it's on you'd sit and watch it. so i was quite shocked that it was getting a sequel further shocked when so many people saying how good it is, so i took my four year old and my god this is disney pixar levels of good. how is puss in boots 2 honestly one of all the time great animated films? well i'll try to explain first the animation style is beautiful and perfect for this movie and because it's a different style from the shrek universe movies it stands out. then there's the characters all the main cast are wonderfully voiced (especially the wolf) and their stories are all told so well and developed. big jack horner is one of the best movie villains for years no tragic backstory, no sympathetic qualities just evil for evils sake and loves being evil. i must also mention the wolf, this character may give younger kids nightmares but as they get older they'll appreciate how awesome he is. the music is beautiful too. i could go forever, i love this movie it is a masterpiece and a travesty it never won best animated movie at the oscar's but still i feel it's good enough love that it won't matter. the last thing i can see is a great movie makes you feel lots of different emotions and this does that ,you can laughing one minute to going aww, to crying to craping yourself in terror. this film is a masterpiece."
"1943","the dark knight","deltawdunn",2023-07-17,9," one of dreamworks' best
","movies like this are the perfect counter to those who hold kid's movies to low standards. while this movie does have style, it's not particularly unique in terms of its story. it's a rather standard journey with most of what you'd expect from an animated kids movie. comedy relief sidekick, expected love interest, an irredeemable villain, etc etc... however, it does all of these so well that the predictability didn't matter. i know puss won't die, but the scenes with death are still tense because i buy puss' fear. after a while i knew goldie's wish would be for a human family and that by the end she'd learn to appreciate her bear family, but that doesn't change that it's very well done. big jack horner is cartoonishly evil, but he's the funniest character, and there are other characters who are actually well-developed so it didn't really matter. it has good action, a great opener, and some cool editing choices. aside from the great visual style and the fact that it expertly juggles three villain factions, this movie is pretty basic, but still great.it's not perfect though. in particular, i think the section at mama luna's was pretty meh. honestly, i don't think i'd care if the movie wasn't so tight, but the character mama luna herself wasn't really relevant and considering the prevalence of these scenes in the trailer, i think this could've been studio interference. maybe not though, one shouldn't assume that anything bad in a movie is due to execs.regardless, this is a great movie, easily top 5 in dreamwork's catalog, and probably higher. it's either an 8/10 or 9/10, can't really decide."
"1944","the dark knight","jph-65157",2023-08-02,9," beautifully animated, cool action sequences, funny new/returning characters, and full of important life lessons.
","when i first heard about the last wish, and saw some of the trailers, i thought it was going to be a bit goofy and not as good as the first one (though seeing puss say ""no hablo ingl√©s"" to get out of talking to that dog made me chuckle) and the stylized animation looked cheap and kind of hurt my eyes and i wasn't that interested. however, once i saw a few clips of it, i thought it looked rather interesting and decided to give a shot.after i finally watched it, i have to admit it was actually very good and comparable to the first puss in boots movie and in some cases, even better. the premise was interesting, the animation actually was pretty good, the stylized animation actually worked out pretty well (especially for the action sequences), full of new characters that were funny and cool, and had some important life lessons for everyone to remember and use in their everyday lives.so i liked the premise because puss using up eight of his nine lives and trying to get to the last wish to gain them back while also battling a bunch of other characters who want the wish sets up a cool and interesting story that'll keep you hooked to see who actually gets the wish. you can kind of guess what will happen in the end, but you still want to see what happens regardless.the animation was pretty beautiful as well because although they did not use the realistic animation of the shrek movies or the first puss in boots movie, having it stylized and more comic book-like works out well here as it makes the movie look more vivid and gives you a more fairy tale vibe. plus, there were more details they could add to the characters and the scenery as well. also, as much it kind of looked cheap, the stylized animation worked out well for some of the action scenes and made them look pretty cool and graphic and added more suspense to the fight scenes between the good guys and the bad guys.the characters were also pretty cool as well. puss (once again voiced by antonio banderas) is just as funny, cool, and energetic as he always was in the previous films, kitty softpaws (once again voiced by selma hayek) adds some great humor and banter with puss once again in his mission, and the new characters were quite interesting too. perrito, the little dog (voiced by harvey guill√©n), is pretty funny and although plays the typical annoying sidekick, his role works out pretty well here as he helps puss and kitty. goldilocks and the three bears (voiced by florence pugh, olivia colman, ray winstone, and samson kayo) add some funny humor as well and their banter with each other is quite hilarious as well. big jack horner, one of the villains (voiced by john mulaney), is certainly devious and sarcastic, and his dark humor is ironically quite funny at times (i mean, if he's voiced by mulaney, then obviously it's going to be funny, due to his rather deadpan delivery of his lines).then there's the wolf (voiced by wagner moura), who serves as the other villain in this, but way darker and more sinister than jack horner. specifically, he is really the grim reaper who is after puss for him cheating death eight times and wants to take his last life as punishment, even though puss is still alive. now, when i say this character is dark, he--is--dark! like from his red eyes to his hooded figure to his low, slow, creepy sounding voice to his spine chilling/goosebump inducing whistling to his only intention of claiming puss' last life, this is a dark villain done right and probably one of the best ones in any dreamworks movie in a long time. heck, i was surprised the directors and writers made the wolf as dark as they did as it would certainly freak out some kids, and even some adults as well. at the same time though, i'll give them credit for really stepping it up here and making a very interesting and intimidating villain, as well as not making him a surprise villain too and you knew he was a villain from the beginning (the surprise villain trope has been used too much lately and it was nice to have the obvious villain trope come back once again in my opinion). i would say if you have kids, viewer discretion is advised for the wolf's scenes, but it's just a few scenes and it's not constantly.now for the themes, they were definitely important ones that i believe we all should consider in our daily lives. i won't try to spoil anything with them, but the themes presented in the last wish involve being happy with the family you grew up with even if they're not your biological family, being around people (and animals) that you can trust, and also, accepting that death is an inevitable thing, but that means living life to the fullest and enjoying every moment of it and do not waste it. again, not trying to spoil too much, but they were presented really well in the last wish that will definitely grasp your attention and might even get you thinking about how things are going with your life and might make you consider making some better changes for yourself.alright, so i know that was a lot to say here, but i just wanted to go over everything that i liked about the last wish. i know it's been out for a while now, but for those who haven't seen it yet, i'd recommend giving it a chance because it's definitely one of the better animated movies that have come out in recent years and it's one that i'm sure you'll love instantly once you watch it. it does have its serious moments, but it has a good blend of that and humor and some touching moments that hit you in the feels. lastly, if you're a fan of puss in boots, then seeing him in action once again will definitely satisfy your movie going needs.so if you have netflix, apple tv, or any other streaming service puss in boots: the last wish is on, go watch it!!!"

","it was a refreshing experience, this beautiful story tells you the importance of the one life we all got. after a long time, i watched a dreamworks animated movie. well, it tried to make a new animation style, taking inspiration from 'into the spider-verse' 2d effects but also not losing their original stylized 3d style, i like it.fairy tale and say what, a fun & life moral centric story focuses on puss's story, making him take life seriously and that's interesting. but the best part of the whole movie was, the antagonist, death... i mean hat's off to death's acting, dialogues, and animation, you can count him as one of the coldest villains on your list. his whistle literally is scary, it feels good to listen but the tone isolates, as if it's a warning that death is coming to you. he is the highlight of this movie. also, i personally, like the story of the side characters, goldi and bears, or probably i liked goldi's character design and character arc.i'll recommend if you looking for something fun and life refreshing story, then definitely check this out because i bet you will be impressed by death's presence in scenes."

","it may seem like puss in boots: the last wish pointless ridiculous film on the surface ..... but there is a lot to like about this animated dreamworks film; the movie delivers on several levels making it worth your time seeking out . i am praising the overall aesthetic. the animation is more advanced, the movie looked like it was a fairy tale painting. takes advantage of modern cg technologies lovingly paired with more traditional 2d techniques. in the opening, the film uses more hand-drawn techniques like your yesteryear cartoons . and as it progresses the technique harnessed new advancements in cg technology to reintroduce this fairy tale world in new and refreshing way.....it is quite the spectacle to witness and in 3d to boot !!! not the same old cg. in the animation, they actually took off motion blur so that it frames stutters . i have actually never seen animation technique like this before ! really made this fantastical hybrid.puss in boots: the last wish mashed up a spaghetti western with a fairy tale, so you get those beautiful western compositions and staging opportunities, but then you get these fantastical locations born out of your imagination.puss in boots discovers that his passion for adventure has taken its toll: he has burnt through eight of his nine lives. puss sets out on an epic journey to find the mythical last wish and restore his nine lives.and the movie is all brought to life with a cast full of oscar nominated and winner actors; it makes all the sense in the world when you've got an entire universe populated by iconic fairy tale characters like goldilocks (florence pugh), the three bears (olivia colman, ray winstone, and samson kayo), the big bad wolf (wagner moura), little jack horner (john mulaney), and even puss himself (antonio banderas).this is a ""must-see"" for all. there are so many takeaways. this movie kept me wanting more. it was great to see all the fairy tale characters in play wanting something they already possessed, needing to appreciate the moment--learning to be mindful of what we already have around us everyday. it's equal parts exciting and hilarious as well as earnest. puss in boots: the last wish mixes stunning animation with a poignant, surprisingly mature story . 8/10."

","i've been a fan of puss in boots ever since i saw the first movie in 2011. i love his charm, his wit, and his badassery. so when i heard that there was going to be a new puss in boots movie, i was beyond excited.ah, puss in boots, the last wish movie - a nostalgic journey that whisked me back to a time when my biggest concern was deciding between chocolate or vanilla ice cream. with its witty charm and swashbuckling feline hero, this film felt like a warm hug from my childhood, complete with a sprinkle of grown-up humor.as the screen came alive with the mischievous adventures of puss, i couldn't help but chuckle at his charismatic swagger. that confident strut and those pleading eyes - i must admit, i almost believed i could pull off wearing a hat like that without looking utterly ridiculous. almost.the tale unfolds with all the whimsy of a fairy tale, complete with a daring quest and an oh-so-noble motive - the last wish. now, i've never met a talking cat in real life (although i've had my suspicions about mr. whiskers next door), but puss's banter with his furry and cute companions had me in stitches. it's like the avengers, but with furballs. genius.puss in boots: the last wish did not disappoint. it was everything i wanted it to be and more. the animation was beautiful, the story was engaging, and the humor was on point. but what really made the movie for me was the heart.this movie is a love letter to puss in boots and his fans. it's a story about a cat who is coming to terms with his mortality. it's a story about friendship, love, and finding your purpose in life. and it's a story that will stay with me long after i've seen it.i'm not going to lie, there were a few moments when i teared up. but it was the good kind of tears. the kind of tears that come from being deeply moved by a story.if you're a fan of puss in boots, then you need to see this movie. it's a must-see for any fan of animation, adventure, or heartwarming stories."

","don't get me wrong, i liked the first movie a lot but i had issues with it. humpty dumpty is one of the most confusing and dumb villains ever in dreamworks history, and kitty didn't felt like her own character and she was rendered a bit pathetically. however fortunately the last wish doesn't have those problems. kitty actually felt like her own character with her own choices and the villain is a huge improvement over humpty dumpty. instead of the confusing story we got, death was excellent. he was absolutely terrifying and a fitting antagonist for puss for about death. but the overall villain was jack horner and just like any other good villains, he was actively threatening, and a good story to back it up. the first had great action but this had a great great action if you know what i mean. only the kung fu panda and spider verse movies beat this in action. i particularly liked the climactic final duel between puss and death, it's such a creative battle and colorful as well. speaking of colorful, it was a wise move to adopt to the comic style animation instead of rest of the shrek franchise with realistic 3d animation. and one more praise are the messages, the first barely had a message to begin with because the message was bogged down by the confusing plot involving humpty. however the message was well and clearly told during this film because of family trope. goldie ended up appreciating her current family and puss himself ended up appreciating his friends and kitty instead of glory and fame which is a pretty strong message.however i just have one complaint. wasn't kitty and puss madly in love at the end of the first movie? i felt like they did it all over again and puss's arch in the first 30mins was a bit confusing which holds it back from becoming my 2nd favorite dreamworks film and a 10/10

"1961","the dark knight","oktay_tuna",2023-01-12,9," a strange comparison(with breaking bad) and then some
","in the shrek movies, puss in boots was a very likable character. i think it is safe to assume that most of the people who love shrek (specifically shrek 2) also enjoy seeing puss in boots. it is enjoyable to watch him, doesn't interfere much with the themes of movies but has funny scenes and great action. as i was thinking of these things, i realized something. he is just like saul goodman from breaking bad. saul goodman is a great character in breaking bad. he is great in scenes he is in and is so fun to watch but he isn't much of a character. then better call saul came and saul goodman (jimmy mcgill) became as complex as (if not more) walter. first puss in boots movie wasn't like that for puss. it was more of the same in shrek movies. this movie delivers the character puss in boots desperately needed and then some. his arc in this movie is amazing and in a perfect world, the script of this movie would get an adapted screenplay nomination at the oscars this year (considering the fact that the competition in the adapted screenplay category is nonexistent).death is an amazing villain. having shorter screen time than most characters makes him an even better character. again another comparison to better call saul, death is like lalo salamanca. lalo also doesn't have a big screen time in the six seasons of the show, but he is easily one of the most memorable characters. death is always there, back in the audience's mind, and just when you forget that he exists, he returns. his whistle, his charisma... brilliant!puss and kitty's storyline and conflict are very complex when you remember that this is an animated movie mostly targeted at kids. the themes of legacy, the meaning of life, and the fear of attachment are very refreshing to see in an animated movie again. the addition of perrito creates a great contrast between him and puss and i would even go further to say that it can even spark some philosophical discussions about which way to live is better for you. legacy or living a life where you are comfortable with your family.i loved the additions of the three bears and goldilocks. their storyline was also fairly interesting to see progress but its pacing could have been better, which makes them the weakest links of the film which is a d**n good weak link if you ask me. the character of jack horner. he has very funny moments and is very interesting to see a villain who is truly deeply villainous with no point of return in an animated movie. the conscience bug thing was also interesting to see unfold.the animation and action scenes are superb. especially the ones with death. death is so good that i can't believe it. there are many jokes that land, songs that are fun and most importantly the movie structurally works. it just works. with this many characters, with this many plotlines, with this many detours, you might think that it is impossible to tie this in a great package. but they do. when this movie is at its worst, it is decent but when it is at its best it is one of the best-animated movies, ever.where did this movie come from? i would have wanted to be a kid when i first watched this movie. i would have been scared but i would have loved it. then i would have watched it again, sometime. and then again. it would have created nostalgia and at my age today when i would have looked back i would have said, ""it is not the best-animated movie ever, but it is my favorite animated movie ever."" because it would have been. what more can i say?"

","""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a fun adventure in the ""shrek"" universe! i gotta admit i have not seen the original film, and don't cherish the ""shrek"" films as much as many do... so i went into this with mild expectations. and honestly, i had a good time; it was cute! do i think it was as good as many other reviewers have suggested? no. but it was enjoyable, lighthearted fun that is perfect for families with kids! the voice cast was awesome, especially john mulaney and florence pugh as the villains, jack horner and goldilocks respectively. and of course antonio banderas as puss in boots is iconic as ever!the animation here was gorgeous too, honestly it was one of my favourite parts. i love that major studio animated movies are finally starting to take more risks with their animation style, moving away from the typical 3d cgi realism. you gotta respect ""spider-man: into the spider-verse"" for starting this trend and showing that different styles can work! i loved that this had a more watercolor, storybook illustration look to it, it really worked for the story and was employed in such creative ways! i would love to see the ""shrek"" movies take this on, but alas they seem to have established their own look. this movie just looked so cool, so distinct in its own style, it really felt like i was watching a story in a fairy tale world.now, of course i have to admit i didn't love this movie. something about it felt off to me, i couldn't seem to see where the acclaim was coming from. sure, it was fun, it was cute, and i enjoyed myself while watching, but i never felt like i truly connected with the film. the opening scene felt a little jumbled to me, rapidly going from a musical sequence, to comedy for kids, to an action scene and i wished it would've let me settle into the story a bit first. i get this is a movie primarily for kids, but with most animation they tend to make parts enjoyable for the parents and older audiences as well. i don't really feel that here - they tried with the themes and the deeper storyline - but it never actually worked in my eyes. everything felt very kid-focused, which isn't a bad thing, it just meant i wasn't the core audience and so it makes sense why i wouldn't enjoy it as much. i have to say, the kids in my theatre seemed to be having a blast! i'm sure this is a great movie for families with children, it just wasn't as good as i was told it would be.i think the movie tried to do a bit of what pixar is known for, the whole ""trying to be deep"" thing. the movie involves puss in boots coming to terms with death, and it seemed to be somewhat shallow, it never truly dove into this aspect of the story. instead, the storyline is very linear and somewhat dull where it is just about the characters traveling to their destination and the villains sometimes catching up and then combat ensuing. and the physical goal literally being the spiritual goal just makes the inevitable plot point of ""maybe i don't need the thing i wanted all long and it's the friends i made along the way that count"" seem all the more predictable. even puss' relationship with the side characters is unchallenging. although he is deeply flawed, his companions never seem to care about that and forgive him all the time. the chemistry of the characters was just nowhere as endearing as in ""shrek"". still the adventure was quite fun, i just didn't think the themes clicked as it felt like they were trying to be deep in a way that is not as organic and surprising as a film like pixar's ""up"", ""finding nemo"" or even dreamworks' ""how to train your dragon"".perhaps i am being too harsh, i feel like this review is sounding more negative than anything. i really did have fun with it, and overall would give it a thumbs up, it's an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half. the animation was really cool, the voice cast was great, and man i loved the little nods to the ""shrek"" movies even if i was never a huge fan of those. if nothing else, this movie did make me really hopeful for another ""shrek"" film. i do enjoy this fairy tale world and the creative animation they used to tell the story!"

"1965","the dark knight","deltawdunn",2023-07-17,9," one of dreamworks' best
","movies like this are the perfect counter to those who hold kid's movies to low standards. while this movie does have style, it's not particularly unique in terms of its story. it's a rather standard journey with most of what you'd expect from an animated kids movie. comedy relief sidekick, expected love interest, an irredeemable villain, etc etc... however, it does all of these so well that the predictability didn't matter. i know puss won't die, but the scenes with death are still tense because i buy puss' fear. after a while i knew goldie's wish would be for a human family and that by the end she'd learn to appreciate her bear family, but that doesn't change that it's very well done. big jack horner is cartoonishly evil, but he's the funniest character, and there are other characters who are actually well-developed so it didn't really matter. it has good action, a great opener, and some cool editing choices. aside from the great visual style and the fact that it expertly juggles three villain factions, this movie is pretty basic, but still great.it's not perfect though. in particular, i think the section at mama luna's was pretty meh. honestly, i don't think i'd care if the movie wasn't so tight, but the character mama luna herself wasn't really relevant and considering the prevalence of these scenes in the trailer, i think this could've been studio interference. maybe not though, one shouldn't assume that anything bad in a movie is due to execs.regardless, this is a great movie, easily top 5 in dreamwork's catalog, and probably higher. it's either an 8/10 or 9/10, can't really decide."
"1966","the dark knight","jph-65157",2023-08-02,9," beautifully animated, cool action sequences, funny new/returning characters, and full of important life lessons.
","when i first heard about the last wish, and saw some of the trailers, i thought it was going to be a bit goofy and not as good as the first one (though seeing puss say ""no hablo ingl√©s"" to get out of talking to that dog made me chuckle) and the stylized animation looked cheap and kind of hurt my eyes and i wasn't that interested. however, once i saw a few clips of it, i thought it looked rather interesting and decided to give a shot.after i finally watched it, i have to admit it was actually very good and comparable to the first puss in boots movie and in some cases, even better. the premise was interesting, the animation actually was pretty good, the stylized animation actually worked out pretty well (especially for the action sequences), full of new characters that were funny and cool, and had some important life lessons for everyone to remember and use in their everyday lives.so i liked the premise because puss using up eight of his nine lives and trying to get to the last wish to gain them back while also battling a bunch of other characters who want the wish sets up a cool and interesting story that'll keep you hooked to see who actually gets the wish. you can kind of guess what will happen in the end, but you still want to see what happens regardless.the animation was pretty beautiful as well because although they did not use the realistic animation of the shrek movies or the first puss in boots movie, having it stylized and more comic book-like works out well here as it makes the movie look more vivid and gives you a more fairy tale vibe. plus, there were more details they could add to the characters and the scenery as well. also, as much it kind of looked cheap, the stylized animation worked out well for some of the action scenes and made them look pretty cool and graphic and added more suspense to the fight scenes between the good guys and the bad guys.the characters were also pretty cool as well. puss (once again voiced by antonio banderas) is just as funny, cool, and energetic as he always was in the previous films, kitty softpaws (once again voiced by selma hayek) adds some great humor and banter with puss once again in his mission, and the new characters were quite interesting too. perrito, the little dog (voiced by harvey guill√©n), is pretty funny and although plays the typical annoying sidekick, his role works out pretty well here as he helps puss and kitty. goldilocks and the three bears (voiced by florence pugh, olivia colman, ray winstone, and samson kayo) add some funny humor as well and their banter with each other is quite hilarious as well. big jack horner, one of the villains (voiced by john mulaney), is certainly devious and sarcastic, and his dark humor is ironically quite funny at times (i mean, if he's voiced by mulaney, then obviously it's going to be funny, due to his rather deadpan delivery of his lines).then there's the wolf (voiced by wagner moura), who serves as the other villain in this, but way darker and more sinister than jack horner. specifically, he is really the grim reaper who is after puss for him cheating death eight times and wants to take his last life as punishment, even though puss is still alive. now, when i say this character is dark, he--is--dark! like from his red eyes to his hooded figure to his low, slow, creepy sounding voice to his spine chilling/goosebump inducing whistling to his only intention of claiming puss' last life, this is a dark villain done right and probably one of the best ones in any dreamworks movie in a long time. heck, i was surprised the directors and writers made the wolf as dark as they did as it would certainly freak out some kids, and even some adults as well. at the same time though, i'll give them credit for really stepping it up here and making a very interesting and intimidating villain, as well as not making him a surprise villain too and you knew he was a villain from the beginning (the surprise villain trope has been used too much lately and it was nice to have the obvious villain trope come back once again in my opinion). i would say if you have kids, viewer discretion is advised for the wolf's scenes, but it's just a few scenes and it's not constantly.now for the themes, they were definitely important ones that i believe we all should consider in our daily lives. i won't try to spoil anything with them, but the themes presented in the last wish involve being happy with the family you grew up with even if they're not your biological family, being around people (and animals) that you can trust, and also, accepting that death is an inevitable thing, but that means living life to the fullest and enjoying every moment of it and do not waste it. again, not trying to spoil too much, but they were presented really well in the last wish that will definitely grasp your attention and might even get you thinking about how things are going with your life and might make you consider making some better changes for yourself.alright, so i know that was a lot to say here, but i just wanted to go over everything that i liked about the last wish. i know it's been out for a while now, but for those who haven't seen it yet, i'd recommend giving it a chance because it's definitely one of the better animated movies that have come out in recent years and it's one that i'm sure you'll love instantly once you watch it. it does have its serious moments, but it has a good blend of that and humor and some touching moments that hit you in the feels. lastly, if you're a fan of puss in boots, then seeing him in action once again will definitely satisfy your movie going needs.so if you have netflix, apple tv, or any other streaming service puss in boots: the last wish is on, go watch it!!!"

","'puss in boots: the last wish (2022)' is brilliant. teeming with energy from the moment it begins, this animated adventure is as exhilarating as it is emotionally mature. it balances its swashbuckling action, quick-witted comedy, emotional character work and surprisingly poignant musings on mortality incredibly well. there isn't a moment of the perfectly paced piece that feels out of pace. it truly is an absolute blast. it's also beautiful, with stylishly snappy animation that immediately grabs you by the collar and drags you into the colourful storybook setting. the action scenes, in particular, are a real highlight; you're sure to have a smile on your face for each and every one. except, perhaps, those involving the wolf - not because they aren't wonderful, but because they're shockingly scary. the big bad is genuinely terrifying on occasion and his introductory scene is nothing short of a masterpiece. the internal conflict he inspires in the central character is arguably what elevates the picture to another level, and the literal manifestations of this conflict are inarguably the highlights of the entire affair. the characters all have a good amount of depth to them and they're brought to life with vital voicework that never misses a beat. even the usually annoying cute sidekick is here a sincere, funny and likeable presence that adds genuine value to the narrative. there's very little not to like here. one thing that's perhaps worth mentioning is that there's one scene in which a certain character seems to have been rendered unlit, leading to a distracting sense that the shots in which they appear are literally unfinished. some of the character arcs are predictable and there are a couple of jokes that don't quite land, too. these really are very minor flaws, though. ultimately, this is a ton of fun from start to finish. it's the sort of thing that puts a smile on your face simply because of how well achieved it is. it's phenomenal."

","emerald fennell delivers a film with handsome production values and a good music score. that's about it. as the opening scene rolled, i feared the creative team regarded themselves too highly because their cinematic curiosity is presented in the old pre-hd 4:3 aspect ratio. i was right. pretentious! what unfolds is sophomoric rather than witty. saltburn is embarrassing rather than shocking. i'm not repulsed by shock and awe cinema. i rather loved american psycho. (by mary harron, also a female director). and for anyone lucky enough to have seen ""andy warhol's frankenstein"" in 3-d... knows that bizarre, deviant behavior, murder and mayhem can be delightfully amusing. (note: that film was written and directed by paul morrissey with warhol's name attached as a box office draw.) saltburn, however, isn't entertaining, fun or comical. it delivers something unseemly and highly unenjoyable. the performances are solid enough, with the exception of the lead. i found the actor creepy and extremely unappealing. not his character, which was the bad guy, but the actor himself. he was no christian bale playing patrick bateman, or anthony hopkins playing hannibal lecter, that's for damn sure. of course they are great actors, and were performing great and worthy material."
"1984","the dark knight","snoopystyle",2023-12-28,8," let's talk about it
","it's 2006. oliver quick (barry keoghan) is an outsider nerd in oxford university. most of the other students seem to be upper-crust from the cool kids' table. the head of that table is felix catton (jacob elordi). oliver works to befriend felix who invites oliver to his family's estate called saltburn to join his parents (richard e. grant, rosamund pike), his sister venetia (alison oliver), his less-well-off cousin farleigh start (archie madekwe), and poor dear pamela (carey mulligan).this is emerald fennell's second directorial full length theatrical movie. she hit the first one out of the park with the critics and everybody is expecting a lot from her. i love this one more than ""promising young woman"". that seems to be a minority opinion. certainly, the style and the daring and the edge are all right there in both movies. in this one, i'm not questioning the reality of the situation.it all boils down to barry keoghan. his eyes are so unique. he looks both innocent and like a serial killer. from the beginning, i am assuming that he is inject little lies to get into the inner circle. i just couldn't understand his feelings for felix. that's why i love his final explanation of both loving and hating him. i thought he had a misstep dealing with venetia. he should have neg her by saying she failed his demand to eat. that would have kept her wrapped around his finger. the movie's biggest misstep is the section with the reveals. the first reveal of the bicycle tire is great. the money at the bar is interesting, but it's not that surprising. at the time, the audience thought he's poor, but by the end, we know he has middle class money. the farleigh reveal is no reveal. anybody with a brain knows what happened. the felix reveal is only interesting in its details. the venetia reveal is problematic in that her suicide needs to be expanded right away. by then, the audience knows oliver is doing the killings. as for elspeth, i would have prefer a marriage first and that murder is too blatant. the whole last act is a bit of a stumble, but i do love the rest."

","a talented cast including richard e. grant, rosamund pike, and carey mulligan was wasted on a terrible script with clunky dialogue and a half-baked meandering plot that runs out of steam in the third act. anyone who has seen ""the talented mr. ripely"" will guess that oliver will ingratiate himself with felix, become obsessed with him, do something that weirds him out, and kill him, all in the first 5 minutes of the film. as soon as you see oliver looking at the hedge maze you know that's where he will kill felix. as soon as felix tells oliver he has a ""surprise"" for his birthday, a ""road trip"", you know he's going to take him to see his mother, you know she'll turn out to be perfectly nice and not an addict, and that dad's actually alive and a responsible citizen, too. and once venetia starts calling oliver out after felix's funeral, you know she's going to die. then the supposed ""twist"" at the end is so clumsily set up that it makes m night shyamalan's forced, formulaic plot twists look like freaking hitchcock. it's incredibly unbelievable. oliver saw felix at oxford, just knew if he punctured felix's bicycle tire and then lent him his while pretending to be poor and awkward and pitiable, felix would take him under his wing, invite him to his country manor house so oliver could manipulate the foilbles he just knew felix's gentry family would have, kill them off one by one until he could manipulate the bereaved matriarch into signing over the whole estate to him, which was as legally implausible as it was logically implausible (good thing for ollie wealthy titled socially connected families never have cadet branches that might have something to say about some nobody popping up and having control of the estate signed over to him after three closely timed untimely deaths).and just as there is no rhyme or reason why even the most brilliant mastermind should think that such a far fetched plan that involves passively hoping multiple variables outside his control come to pass, there is also no plausible explanation given for why oliver should choose to target this family. he supposedly loved felix until felix got creeped out by his lies (back to the talented mr ripley rehash), but even before his lies about his parents were discovered, he was screwing venetia and the farleigh for reasons that don't seem to serve his machinations or plot or character development and would threaten his chances with felix. then it is he hated felix, the one guy at oxford who was kind and accepting of him unconditionally. some class warfare motivation is implied, the poor kid (checks notes) scratch that, comfortably middle class kid env√≠es rich kid (yawn). and then there is the implication maybe oliver did all this just because he's a sociopath, which is a lazy cop out. it's like in a bizarre case of alternative pleading as plot development, director/screenwriter fannell is throwing character motivation options against the wall like so much undercooked pasta to see what sticks.and oliver is not the only character who is poorly fleshed out. the farleigh character is well acted and succeeds in making the audience hate him, but oliver is so over the top creepy and cringy that farleigh's douchebaggery towards him does practically nothing to build audience empathy for oliver. and the way oliver is able to get farleigh disowned so easily by revealing his coke use is as anticlimactic as it is unbelievable. carey mulligan's character is so one dimensional, and barely there before she's unceremoniously killed offscreen with no impact on the characters or the audience that you wonder why fannell bothered to cast a name actor like mulligan in the role at all. richard e grant is the slightly dotty hereditary member of the leisure class, a tired stock character, as is rosamund pike's facilely effusive but actually flinty upper class british woman character, as is venetia's poor little rich girl/wild child.a a psychological thriller this movie is a failure. as a social satire this movie is a failure. as an absurdist black comedy this movie is a failure. it only serves to make the audience uncomfortable for 2 hours while failing to deliver a payoff in either humor or smart ploy list or incisive commentary that would make that discomfort worth it in the end."

","it's not easy to rate this. there were things i liked but overall, it's deeply flawed.1) its running time was not a problem. this is a 130 minutes movie but it never got boring. it was interesting all the way, but if something is interesting, it doesn't mean it's good too. an accident is an interesting thing, people might peep as they are passing by. but still, accidents are not something nice. at times, this movie is like an accident on a highway. it's catching the eye and you can't look the other way. but still you don't like what you see.2) there are great actors here. however the script didn't help them. for example, rosamund pike's character is not well written. she does the best possible acting but her lines were weird and awkward. especially the things she did during the last 30-ish minutes. i won't spoil this but the last 30 minutes half ruined this movie. not just pike's character. shocking for shock's sake. the grave scene -you'll know if you see it- is comically abhorrent. if you are 20 years old, maybe the wholw ending would look impressive and brilliant to you. if you get older, you are gonna laugh due to its stupidity.3) barry keoghan is a great actor, too. but he can't carry a movie like this on his shoulders. he is talented but not charismatic. it's not his fault of course that someone thought he is capable to pull a ""pasolini's theorem"" remake (not exactly but close) with him as the leading character. he was not convincing even though he tried hard. he is thrilling in many movies. but he is not as gifted as this role demands.4) theorem aside, this is so derivative it hurts. i won't mention another movies but this is so copycat that it ends up having no identity. this is a hollow and empty movie. so uninspired that it looks like an unintentional parody. this director's previous movie was very good ( promising young woman). saltburn is not.5) having said that, i'll still give it six stars because at times, i thought this gonna be good. it tricked me and i'll give it some points because of that. it was a fun ride and there were many intense scenes. usually, i hate it when there is not a single likeable character in a movie, but i didn't care about it here. it was a bit intriguing, i couldn't guess where it goes, during the first 90 minutes. i think there is a good movie inside this movie. it should be more ""polished"" and classy, it should have a voice of its own instead of being a copy. unfortunately, this is kinda ""cheap"" and tasteless. but still i would have rated it higher if the ending was not so disastrous."

","it's quite insane, and i love it. i don't entirely agree with the comments suggesting that ""oliver is money-sexual."" his meticulous design from the beginning is to get close to felix, creating a connection beyond the distant and almost pitiful distance between the prince and the dark corner.it seems similar to ""genius loci,"" but there are subtle differences in emotional depth and direction. the male lead in genius loci wants to become the second male lead, live the second male lead's life, secretly wear his clothes and shoes when the second male lead is not at home - desires surpassing mere infatuation.oliver is different. he enters oxford, glimpses felix through the window surrounded by a courtyard crowd, and falls deeply in love with him at first sight.oliver is an outsider, an oddity, despite being intelligent and diligent-reading fifty books in one summer, writing a substantial thesis, knowledgeable, yet unable to win the affection or even much attention from classmates.he knows what type of person felix would be interested in, understands what roles his middle-class background (actually, upper-middle class) allows him to play. the roles with the highest chance of success, the scripts most likely to secure friendships - he grabs them all.a significant part of oliver's infatuation with felix is due to felix's privileged background. it's the upper class that can nurture someone like felix - carefree, handsome, and charming. easily garnering affection from everyone at parties, pointing out the most beautiful girls, a comprehensive abundance in both material and emotional aspects.oliver might lament the lack of love for him, while felix frets over too much love from others.felix's sympathy for the weak is his virtue, a trait oliver exploits. this kindness seems pure but also like an aloof upper-class person observing a human tragedy from a distance - akin to an audience enjoying a spectacular death in a horror movie, sighing with a mix of sympathy and satisfaction.but pamela, oliver, and the briefly mentioned ""eddie from last summer,"" each one of them is vividly alive.felix and his mother squeeze stories out of their ""friends,"" just like losing interest in a once-beloved movie after repeated viewings. the ""friends,"" along with their luggage, are sent away by the loyal butler at night or in the morning, never disturbing the master's enjoyment of solitude.oliver's infatuation with felix deepens time and again. it's inevitable. despite having money in his wallet, he pretends not to when paying the bill. though he's 80% sure felix is aware of his predicament, when felix actually walks over, pays for him, and adds, ""i found the money you dropped on the ground,"" to save face in front of the bartender, oliver is genuinely relieved.when it's good, it's genuinely good, like the radiant sun finally noticing the weeds growing in the corner and generously bathing them in warm light. the warmth is so comforting that, having experienced it once, you never want to go back to the damp, sunless corner.oliver wants to be felix's friend, a good friend, preferably invited to live in the dreamy castle forever.when felix's cousin mocks him, saying, ""living in the castle is a dream for you, something you can only reminisce about in the future. but for me, this is my home, and i can return anytime.""what is oliver thinking? probably that even if it's a dream, he wants to replace reality with it, to be intoxicated in this dream for a long, long time.he doesn't plan to tell children the story of that summer on a recliner decades later. he wants to plunder the master of this dream, deviously stealing the authority to dream.what if felix forgives him, responds to this love, even if it's just a little, forgiving his deception, letting him stay in the castle? it's an ideal and perfect scenario that shatters. only plundering, only treacherous acts remain. he kills the love that won't stay and trades it for a castle that can only be guarded in place.crazy love, crazy infatuation. i wonder, what if felix forgives? what if he responds to this love?this is a direction untouched by both ""genius loci"" and this movie, and a direction that could never be explored. if it did, it might turn into... an original bl story?haha."

","saltburn is one of the most confusing storylines ever. the plot doesn't stick together and doesn't make sense at all. everything starts with a boy with a hidden secret that he's gay. then he's not, then he is, and suddenly something different happens. you know, it's nothing in the plot that you can connect to or feel concerned about, until the end. the end concludes the story, and everything makes suddenly sense. but the previous hour and forty minutes, doesn't. the main character (that is either protagonist or antagonist, not sure) is not likable, even if they tried to make you like him. the audience is supposed to be concerned about him, but the plastic acting, expressions and the character development that nobody gives a damn about doesn't fix the situation either. his ""love"" connection with his friend is showed as a thing that comes in and out of the film, something that's sometimes is very important, while other times they focused on something way different. they waste time on long unnecessary scenes that doesn't change the course of action at all. they even put in some scenes to express our main hero some more, but i interpreted it in a bad way. if i separate the film in three parts, then i would say a confusing beginning, boring middle and a dull, yet understandable ending. two stars for ok pictures and scenography, and an ending that finally concludes this boring story. the music was decent, it fit the film, but not a technical that i got really impressed about. in the end, saltburn was not a good film, a huge waste of time, forgettable, i don't even think you should take a peak on it."

","let's say you're reading these reviews and haven't watched got yet, but now that it's finished are considering the marathon. what's the consensus? in this case, the consensus is accurate, and that is:seasons 1-6: outstanding. deep world-building, intelligent dialogue, epic set-pieces worthy of hollywood, expert acting, detailed plotting, genuine surprises, great soundtrack used sparingly. got is worth watching for these seasons, definitely.season 7: you suddenly notice the writing and plotting has taken a sharp dive downwards in quality. there are inexplicable ideas, inconsistent characterisation and soap-opera dramas. but at least the entertainment value is still very high, so it gets a pass.season 8: this drop chasms down to depths you didn't think possible. the writing has got so amateurish that the still-fantastic production values are no longer enough to save it. if you ever enjoyed lost but were amazed at how bad the final season was, you're in familiar territory here.the biggest problem with the final season was it took us out of the story and got us thinking about its many weaknesses. we lost our suspension of disbelief. fatal for fiction. it also ruined the series-arcs to the point where a rewatch of the entire series is pointless.so can i recommend a got marathon for newcomers? yes, the first 6 seasons are worth the disappointments later on. but best series of all time it is not. it could've been, but dropping the ball in the final stretch puts it behind the following superior series more worthy of your marathon:battlestar galactica (2003-2008)twin peaks (all 3 seasons, plus the movie)breaking bad"

"2105","game of thrones","thelittlesongbird",2017-11-09,10," this is a television show?
","was over-time on a gradual binge of watching 'game of thrones' from the first episode (gradual because of being so busy), having heard nothing but amazing things about it from friends, family and imdb reviewers. plus with such a great cast of talent and a brilliant book series, how could it possibly go wrong? the good news is that 'game of thrones' didn't go wrong. quite the opposite. not only is it a rare television show that does its original source material justice and treats it with respect but it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years. a television show so brilliant that one has to actually check that it was made for television when everything is done to such a high level that it puts many films made today to shame. this is one of the strongest examples of an acclaimed show that deserves every ounce of the praise it's garnered.visually, 'game of thrones' looks amazing. the scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. then there are the special effects that are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. as well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.one cannot talk about 'game of thrones' without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.it is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is. it always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. the story-lines are paced so beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and touch upon complex and sensitive themes with intelligence and tact.whenever there's a set-piece or more action-oriented scene there's always a reason, never there for the sake of it. not only are the set-pieces done with a lot epic scale, superb staging, excitement and dramatic tension but underneath all the scale and flashy attention to detail there is a lot of heart and a multi-layered one. they're not overlong, nor are there out of place elements.characters are a huge part of the appeal too. 'game of thrones' has characters that are so well developed and as close to real life as one can get despite being in a fantasy world. these characters are not hero and villain archetypes (joffrey is the only one close to that, the difference though is that he is an extremely interesting one with a lot of development who ranks well beyond one hundred percent on the threat level scale), they have much more to them and have strengths and flaws. decisions are logical and one doesn't like any character any less when a decision is not the right one because mistakes are acknowledged and learnt from.'game of thrones' cast is full of talented names and, thanks to so well rounded characters and such great writing, nothing but the very best is gotten out of them. even those who are not favourites of mine. big acting standouts are peter dinklage, sean bean, lena headey and jack gleeson (joffrey being the king of all young characters with not a redeeming bone in their body).in conclusion, absolutely outstanding and a rare television show worthy of being a cinematic modern classic. this review may sound superlatively hyperbolic, but to me 'game of thrones' is that good. 10/10 bethany cox"

","game of thrones boasts an intricate plot with complex characters, stunning cinematography, and intense action sequences, especially its many battles and fights. it's hard to deny that it wasn't a cultural phenomenon that captivated me and many others for eight seasons.i've rated game of thrones a nine out of ten for its well-written and multi-layered storytelling, and its fantastic production value. however, despite still having amazing visuals and extremely high production value, like many fans, i was disappointed and to an extent frustrated by the final season's storytelling and how certain plot points were handled, which has lowered my rating from a ten to a nine. despite this, game of thrones still remains for me a must-watch series and i would still highly recommend it to any fan of the fantasy or drama genre in general."

","i would give this an easy 10/10.. if season 8 didn't exist. but it does, unfortunately.season 1-6 10/10 amazing, complex dialogue and intriguing logical story lines with strong character developments, shocking emotional moments and insane action scenes.season 7- 8/10 - still really good but seemed rushed and had some illogical moments that made no sense like the ayra/sansa fall out and the time/teleporting issues beyond the wall which revealed some lazy writing. but all in all filled with great moments and good set up for the final season.season 8- 2/10. i actually don't know where or start. season 8 is a joke. terrible writing. nothing makes sense. the writers have butchered most character developments and given hardly any satisfying conclusions to their story arcs.brans story had no pay off at all and his whole role as the 3 eyed raven proved pointless against the night king.jaime's redemption arc was cut off instantly with real no reason.the night kings death was underwhelming. infact all of episode 3 was poor, with no real structure and poorly written end to the main story line of the show. the battle was shockingly illogical and horrendous tactics. zero white walker fights, limited deaths and ridiculous plot armour. also editing was poor- some moments characters would be surrounded by hundreds of wights but then the next shot they were all gone. the plot armour ruined the battle of winterfell. 'all' the dothraki wiped out in seconds yet samwell tarly can fend them off. laughable.no sansa and cersei interaction of any sort which i would have liked to have seen. although i appreciate this is just my personal disappointment rather than poor writing.-rhaegal taken down by first 3 shots, yet drogon dodges an iron fleets worth of scorpions at kings landing, just to serve the plot. i guess euron forgot about dany's dragon and her forces.-jon does nothing all season (why was he resurrected if he didn't end the long night or atleast become king? the whole point of his resurrection is because the lord of light claimed he was needed alive). speaking of jon, what was the point of his lineage? it didn't change anything apart from give us unconvincing tension between him and danaerys. i kind of like danaerys going mad but it needed a lot more time and thought put into it - it went too far too fast with no substantial development to justify her killing thousands of innocent people. again, laughable. it needed seasons of planning and transitioning her character. after dany's death it just skipped to tyrion's trial and no one seemed phased over her death.anything that required any thought from the writers was done off screen, like arya and sansa finding out about jon's lineage.cersei, the clever mastermind who always has a deceitful plan up her sleeve does nothing but stand looking out of a window all season. what a waste of a character.ayra does not use her faceless abilities. how cool would it have been for something like ayra shockingly kills jaime in order to get his face and uses it to get close to cersei, she thinks she is safe then is stabbed whilst in the arms of her 'brother' who reveals to be ayra. atleast something like that may have been more satisfying a few bricks falling onto her.bran becomes king. urghhh. he literally said countless times he could not be lord of winterfell or rule anymore. why the sudden change of heart? no explanation? oh typical.prince that was promised? oh yeh let's forget about that too. haha we fooled you audience.however, my main issue was not with what happened but with how it all happened. rushed and made no sense.major let downs and bad dialogue throughout. there are some good moments like brienne being knighted, but even that becomes ruined when she sleeps with jaime- their relationship was so much nicer just being about honour and respect for one another. have to appreciate effort by cast, visual and music crew and the few decent scenes as a whole.overall- 9/10 purely on s1-7."

where at first grand scale developments, societal issues and world-spanning intrigues dominated the narration with characters being the pawns of the true overarching story, later in the seasons characters and stereotypical interactions take the stage and the interesting, long developing issues that made the story captivating get resolved in the most unrewarding ways possible. it's incoherent, detached, uninspired writing. it's everything that is bad in mainstream media.all of this because the writers decided they had enough with the show and grew bored with it. so they wanted to wrap it up as soon as possible in order to go on and ruin the star wars franchise (more than it already is). thanks for your disservice!it needs to be mentioned that the overall production, sound design, acting, cinematography, all of these are quite extraordinary and elevate the show quite a bit, even when the writing declines. the quality is amazing. it probably is still worth watching for its entertainment value. it just doesn't pay off. the ending season ruins quite literally everything."

","readers who come to this review later in the series must note that, at the time of this writing, i have only seen the inaugural episode. it's probably safe to say, when dealing with a series of novels as beloved as the song of ice and fire, the most scrutinized aspect of the t.v. adaptation will be how well it holds to the source material. i am here to confirm, as a fierce devotee to the books, that we have nothing to fear.while certain scenes play out differently in execution, the plot remains perfectly intact (so far). the characters have been transplanted well from page to screen, and the actors (most notably peter dinklage) nailed their personalities quite well. however; it is only fair to point out some of the acting seemed a little wooden at times.special effects were well done, though nothing mind-blowing, but the scenery and props perfectly captured the feel of the novels (in my mind at least). it also must be noted that there was just the right amount of nudity, violence and vulgarity to let the audience know they were watching a tale woven for mature viewers without using said nudity, violence and vulgarity as a crutch.all and all, i am very, very pleased with this adaptation, and i went into it expecting to be disappointed. if i were to gripe about anything, it would be that newcomers who have not read the books might not know what to think of this fantasy story for adults. some may shrug it off as fodder for geeks, while others might take offence to what they may see as a defiling of a genre usually meant for children.updateafter watching the entire first season, i can safely say this is perhaps the best adaptation of book into film/tv. while many moments in the show do not match the moments in the book action for action and word for word, the plot is never sacrificed when doing this, and the alterations simply make the story a better fit for a one-hour television time slot.in addition, new scenes (by which i mean scenes which never happened in the book at all) fit seamlessly into the greater plot, and help the audience with information they would only otherwise get via the narrative of the novel (eg: asides which explain character/world history).top form, hbo. top form."

","a delightful animated film that offers fast-paced humor, elaborate visuals, and strong voice acting from a talented cast. antonio banderas once again brings charm and depth to the titular character, and harvey guillen steals the show as the sweet and enthusiastic perrito. the dynamic between puss, perrito, and kitty softpaws (voiced by salma hayek pinault) is engaging and adds substance to what could have been a purely playful endeavor. the film's anime-influenced action sequences are visually striking, and the use of dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves helps to smoothly transition between scenes. overall, ""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a fun and visually appealing adventure that is sure to entertain audiences of all ages."
"2131","game of thrones","planktonrules",2023-03-17,8," a cgi film more for the grown-ups than the kids.
","""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a most unusual cgi film from dreamworks. this is because although kids might like it, it's clearly intended for adults. after all, the film has very strong existential elements....things that would be mostly lost on kids.this film starts with the usual self-assured heroism you would expect in a puss in boots cartoon. but then something most unusual happens...after defying death again and again, puss suddenly realizes his own mortality, as he realizes he's used up eight of his nine lives...and soon he will die once and for all! as a result, he's now afraid to be his old dashing self. so, he goes off in search of some magical wish...in the hopes that he can regain his previous lives. but, not surprisingly, along the way he discovers so much more.the animation is lovely and the story quite enjoyable. there really isn't much to complain about with this story...it's well made and hard not to like. it also is amazingly deep and unusual...not the usual vacuous sequel just made to capitalize on the original film's success."

"2133","game of thrones","huwbutts",2023-02-16,10," puts most recent movies, not just animated movies, to shame.
","in an age when movie and tv franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (i'm looking at you, disney), i don't think anyone was expecting much from puss in boots: the last wish - certainly not i.after the first 5 minutes, i knew this was something special.firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from arkane and enter the spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. the 2d elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.the music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).the dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling i think i've ever seen. in a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. the cast do a great job of selling them too. goldi and the bears come out with brilliant british-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.and then there's the wolf. this character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. his style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, i'm serious).at a time when disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - dreamworks have taken on the mantle.it made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. you might think i'm overselling it, but hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.there are those that say that hollywood is done - i know i do. but dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

-very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.adorable characters/feel
-new characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-the feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-has that element of shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.the animation
-it's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy dreamworks does so well.-the design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-the world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that i certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-and it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than disney for the blend of real and cartoons.the voice acting:
-many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that snl like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. he own the horner character and brought some of the best lines.-wagner moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the big-bad wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-pugh is okay, not my favorite role as goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. it does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-banderas takes boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the spanish stereotype. and yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.the references/jokes
-the stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of shrek.-it's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-the fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-it feels like the first two shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. again, refreshing that they were able to step back.the designs changes to an extent
-creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-like into the spiderverse? good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that puss does.-not overused, which is very good for me.the action at times
-shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-this movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-the ending fight shows the potential of what dreamworks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes i've seen this year.the heart
-lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-the movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-there are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. that's hard to do in many things.-i love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-have not felt this way since shrek 2.dislikes:the darkness
-it's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.predictable
-the lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-the movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.too many antagonists
-one of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-they do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.the comedy is still tapered
-it's starting to go back to shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made shrek, shrek.-they took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.the animation changes at times
-the animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-the comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.the action still not complete
--shrek and shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-this movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-the stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-they sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-often was shorter than i wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.the verdict
i must say, puss in boots: the last wish was a much better film than when i walked in. perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. it evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. and it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. this film is indeed a solid return to the world and i had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. however, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance i was looking for. the movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with puss in boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. and the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the shrek that we saw in the first two movies. still, i do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

"2138","game of thrones","wolfinflannel",2023-10-21,10," restored my faith in animated movies!
","puss and boots: the last wish was a true 'feel good' movie. the plot was well thought out and transitioned flawlessly from the last puss and boots film. what made this different from the previous movie is the mature theme and sentiments that made the film enjoyable and illuminating for all ages. the story progression was smooth and did not make the movie feel too short or too long. the story's theme (life is too short, so we must value what we have) flows through several different angles and characters throughout the story. the theme is not lost during the movie and is carried by the protagonist's emotions and personal growth. the characters in this movie helped express the theme and made the film more enjoyable. puss was the perfect protagonist, and his personal growth in the movie showed the audience that it is never too late for a fresh start, especially given that his character did not transition from the last film to the beginning of this one. kitty and pedrito's contrasting personalities and feelings allow two perspectives to get through to puss and show him what it means to be a family. goldy and the three bears added an extra obstacle for 'team friendship' but highlighted the theme through their growth. death was a great character because he was simply doing his job and was the character that indirectly pushed puss to become a better person and respected him for it. jack horner was an excellent antagonist because he was indeed a villain. instead of a character that was hurt by society or had good intentions deep down, this character was a pure monster. it was refreshing to have a villain that everyone could get behind disliking. the dialogue in this movie was powerful. each sentence helped tell the story, and it did not feel like there were any filler lines. the comic relief was natural, and the emotional conversations were deep. the imagery and background in the film were well articulated and detailed. each setting aligned with the active story and flowed with the transitions. the background music of the story was also fitting; it added an extra layer for the viewer and did not distract them from the story. this movie gave hope for the future of animated movies in america."

","i have seen good movies in the year of 2022, but puss in boots: the last wish (2022) is by far the best animated movie of 2022 and is my favorite movie from that year. also, it is the best movie in the shrek franchise.the voice cast is great; antonio banderas as puss in boots was great, salma hayek was great, and harvey guill√©n as perrito was great because they are good characters, and they are funny. florence pugh as goldilocks, olivia colman as mama bear, ray winstone as papa bear, and samson kayo as baby bear were funny, and they were also good characters.there is this wolf villain in the movie that is legit creepy, was such a cool character. he does certain things that makes him a great villain for puss in boots to go against, and he is voiced by wagner moura who has a great voice for this character.the animation is beautiful in this movie; it has amazing action scenes, pretty scenery, and imaginable locations that look great in this animation style. the movie is also creative in how it uses fairytale locations and items from those stories, which is what makes another villain character voiced by john mulaney funny to watch.the movie has a simple plot but does it in a creative way with great characters, and some little references to shrek. what i especially loved was how puss in boots starts laughing in the face of danger, but because he is on his last life, he starts getting scared and starts thinking about what he has done with his earlier lives and how spent them.i had a fun time with puss in boots: the last wish (2022); it has fantastic animation, it was funny, it has great characters, it has great emotional moments, and there are great action scenes. i highly recommend checking this movie out because you will have gun with it, and i am excited to see this movie again when i get the chance."
"2144","game of thrones","jakebunker",2023-07-08,10," believe the hype
","this is the best animated feature since into the spider-verse, and probably better than toy story 4 and soul. i don't find many movies rewatchable nowadays and this is one of the few. not only is it a visual masterpiece (huge credit to the animators, well done!) but from a critical standpoint is has extremely well done characters, an engaging and relatable story, and takes very bold actions that will leave animation-lovers stunned for years to come. spoilers would be ruining an experience that you simply must witness for yourself, so what are you waiting for? believe the hype, go watch it if you haven't already! 9.5/10 but imma round up.edit: i've given it a year and came back to it and it's just even better the second viewing. in my opinion this is dreamwork's greatest movie (especially if you take away the first 5 minutes), better than kung fu panda, how to train your dragon, even prince of egypt. also the only dreamworks movie that i think deserves a 10/10. it's one thing to make an actually good and compelling story but to be also very entertaining and engaging for everyone is another feat. the user ratings and critics ratings are way too low. most criticisms of the movie are, imo, flawed, non-existent or biased. i sincerely cannot recommend this movie enough."
"2145","game of thrones","soumikbanerjee1996",2023-01-12,8," one darn good entertainer!
","this has caused quite a stir in recent days, and it's it safe to say that it eventually caught my interest. speaking for myself, i knew nothing about puss because i had never seen a single movie in the 'shrek' lineup, which sparked my curiosity even more.to prep for this allegedly wonderful sequel, i had to finish the first film first, which i did. i saw the first puss in boots movie this morning, but to my utter disappointment, it did not meet my expectations, and uncertainty worked its way in. i was worried about whether the sequel would live up to the hype.and i am pleased to report that it did. 'the last wish' may not be among the best films i have ever seen, but it is an interesting and enjoyable watch for sure.the visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the blend of two distinct animation art styles makes for an interesting cinematic experience, the score, too, sprinkled its fair share of magic, and on top of that, the characters are more fleshed out, unlike the last time, and the inclusion of 'perrito' and 'death' brought radical changes to the narrative, their mere presence made this more exciting."

","after losing his eighth life to a bell falling on top of him, puss in boots is down to his last life. an encounter from a vicious bounty hunter with a frightening presence destroys his confidence and for the first time, he feels fear. after escaping by the skin of his teeth, he decides he is no longer worthy of the name puss in boots and begins life as an adopted cat. he learns about the dark forest where someone can make a wish on the wishing star. with this in mind, the crafty feline returns to adventure to get his lives back.a little late to review this movie, but i still caught it in theaters. i knew from the trailer that this would be a cool movie. at first, i was wondering why dreamworks is creating another puss in boots movie. it feels weird to make a sequel to a spin-off that came out over a decade ago. as someone who has not watched the original puss in boots, i do not think you need to watch the original to get what is going on here aside from maybe puss' relationship with kitty softpaws. with that said, let me tell you how good this movie is!puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animated films. first of all, the animation looks absolutely stunning. the movie has probably the best animation from a cgi film i have ever seen. not only do the movement and expressions look smooth and crisp, the cinematography and imagery looks amazing and memorable too. there are many awesome shots in this film such as a shot of puss staring in the eyes of death. these shots strengthen the emotional moments and even some of the funny moments as well. every shot in this movie looks awesome. the animation really shows its fluidity in the action scenes. this movie has better action than 90% percent of the live-action blockbusters out there. the set pieces are so dynamic and entertaining that there is not a boring moment in the film. the opening set piece sets the tone for the entire movie and from that point forward, i knew i was in for a ride. the soundtrack is awesome too from the catchy score to the fun opening song for puss in boots.fantastic visuals aside, the story is memorable too. this movie pushes its pg rating. there is blood, cursing and dark themes that may frighten younger viewers. the story is about how puss is reacting to the idea that he is on deaths door. if he dies one more time, he will be gone forever. this is a movie where we see one of the coolest and most confident characters in animation lose his confidence. with that, he has a character arc that gives him depths and flaws that are relatable so even when he does something kind of selfish, you can still sympathize with his motivations. this movie has a lot of stylish action and funny jokes, but the scenes revolving around the wolf ramp up the dark tone of the movie. it never loses its sense of humor and this is one funny movie. i love the snarky dialogue, perrito gets one scene with goldilocks and the three bears that steals the show comedy wise. this movie has the perfect mix of comedy, action, drama and emotional moments to make it stand out.in addition to a great story, the cast of characters are memorable too. puss is at his best. he is the same awesome and adorable character from shrek, but he is given a lot of vulnerability here. he starts out as this arrogant, but powerful guy who can take down giants, but when he sees that death is coming for him, you can see how it shakes him to the core. his friends kitty softpaws and especially perrito are great characters too. perrito seems like the guy that would annoy everyone, but he is a great support character who is hilarious and just plain adorable. he is also surprisingly aware of emotions. there is one scene with him and puss that warmed my heart.as for the antagonists, the wolf is one of my favorite antagonists in an animated film. he has a badass voice, he completely changes the tone of the movie and he wipes out puss' bravado entirely and reduces him to a frightened cat. he is also a great fighter, but it is his presence, voice, dialogue and whistle that make him truly memorable. kids might have nightmares because of him. goldilocks and the three bears are fun anti-villains that have a sweet bond with each other. then there is the gluttonous scumbag jack horner. this is the character the writers decided to just make as hilariously hatable and disgusting as possible. they make no attempt to give this guy any sympathetic trait and i love it. we need more outright terrible people in new animated films. he is a funny villain with how unapologetic he is towards his minions, but you will be actively rooting for this character's demise.every single character in this film is memorable to a degree. it helps that the voice acting in this movie is excellent with antonio banderas as puss, salma hayek as kitty, harvey gull√©n as perrito, john mulaney as jack horner and especially wagner moura as the wolf. moura might have one of the best voices for a villain in animation i have seen in a while. each person brings their character to life in this movie. i can see any main character here being someone's favorite in the movie. that is how you know that you have a great cast.there is not a dull moment in this movie. puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animation and more. i did not expect a movie like this to be that great, but when i saw the trailers with the gorgeous animation, i knew this movie was going to be a ride. i did not expect it to become one of my favorite films of 2022, but it definitely. i really

","puss in boots: the last wish is the sixth entry in the shrek franchise and a sequel to the spinoff film from over a decade ago. all the writings on the wall screamed cash grab and milking a franchise. yet somehow this movie ended up being an absolute blast to watch!the animation is stylistic, vibrant and gorgeous with animation that is inspired by the spiderverse movies. every frame is whacky and creative! the story is also wonderfully done despite the short runtime. it gives a very poignant and meaningful message to the audience. what surprised me the most though was the action scenes! dreamwork didn't need to go that hard but wow those action scenes are choreographed so well!i don't like milking a franchise for over 20 years but this film gives me slight hope that the next entry might be worth watching."

","""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a most unusual cgi film from dreamworks. this is because although kids might like it, it's clearly intended for adults. after all, the film has very strong existential elements....things that would be mostly lost on kids.this film starts with the usual self-assured heroism you would expect in a puss in boots cartoon. but then something most unusual happens...after defying death again and again, puss suddenly realizes his own mortality, as he realizes he's used up eight of his nine lives...and soon he will die once and for all! as a result, he's now afraid to be his old dashing self. so, he goes off in search of some magical wish...in the hopes that he can regain his previous lives. but, not surprisingly, along the way he discovers so much more.the animation is lovely and the story quite enjoyable. there really isn't much to complain about with this story...it's well made and hard not to like. it also is amazingly deep and unusual...not the usual vacuous sequel just made to capitalize on the original film's success."

"2156","game of thrones","huwbutts",2023-02-16,10," puts most recent movies, not just animated movies, to shame.
","in an age when movie and tv franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (i'm looking at you, disney), i don't think anyone was expecting much from puss in boots: the last wish - certainly not i.after the first 5 minutes, i knew this was something special.firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from arkane and enter the spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. the 2d elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.the music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).the dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling i think i've ever seen. in a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. the cast do a great job of selling them too. goldi and the bears come out with brilliant british-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.and then there's the wolf. this character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. his style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, i'm serious).at a time when disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - dreamworks have taken on the mantle.it made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. you might think i'm overselling it, but hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.there are those that say that hollywood is done - i know i do. but dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."
"2157","game of thrones","thezodiacdozenbooks",2022-12-21,10," the best movie in the entire shrek franchise!
","you heard me! my wife and i just got back from the theater, and absolutely loved this movie, even more than any of the shrek movies and the first puss in boots!this movie has so much to love, from beautiful visuals/action to consistent humor that actually had us laughing to engaging characters, both old and new. such a fun time, and so worth seeing in the theaters, though we'll definitely be picking up a copy once it's out on dvd!without giving too much away, there are several different antagonists in this movie that scratch all the bad-guy itches, covering the spectrum from totally hateable to horrifying to relatable and sympathetic. a great cast! also, the magical world they came up with for this movie was awesome, with some really cool/unique features!at first, we were a little worried about the dog character, neither of us being big fans of daffy sidekicks, but we were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves rooting for him! he's hilarious, and that's coming from a cat-lover!several callbacks to the first puss in boots movie made this one feel less like a spin-off than a worthy standalone franchise, and the movie was packed with magical references that all ages will be able to recognize and enjoy.do yourself a favor and free a few hours for this one!! a rare 10 from me!!"

","likes:pacing
-very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.adorable characters/feel
-new characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-the feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-has that element of shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.the animation
-it's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy dreamworks does so well.-the design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-the world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that i certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-and it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than disney for the blend of real and cartoons.the voice acting:
-many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that snl like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. he own the horner character and brought some of the best lines.-wagner moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the big-bad wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-pugh is okay, not my favorite role as goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. it does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-banderas takes boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the spanish stereotype. and yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.the references/jokes
-the stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of shrek.-it's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-the fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-it feels like the first two shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. again, refreshing that they were able to step back.the designs changes to an extent
-creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-like into the spiderverse? good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that puss does.-not overused, which is very good for me.the action at times
-shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-this movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-the ending fight shows the potential of what dreamworks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes i've seen this year.the heart
-lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-the movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-there are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. that's hard to do in many things.-i love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-have not felt this way since shrek 2.dislikes:the darkness
-it's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.predictable
-the lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-the movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.too many antagonists
-one of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-they do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.the comedy is still tapered
-it's starting to go back to shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made shrek, shrek.-they took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.the animation changes at times
-the animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-the comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.the action still not complete
--shrek and shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-this movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-the stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-they sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-often was shorter than i wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.the verdict
i must say, puss in boots: the last wish was a much better film than when i walked in. perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. it evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. and it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. this film is indeed a solid return to the world and i had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. however, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance i was looking for. the movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with puss in boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. and the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the shrek that we saw in the first two movies. still, i do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

"2161","game of thrones","wolfinflannel",2023-10-21,10," restored my faith in animated movies!
","puss and boots: the last wish was a true 'feel good' movie. the plot was well thought out and transitioned flawlessly from the last puss and boots film. what made this different from the previous movie is the mature theme and sentiments that made the film enjoyable and illuminating for all ages. the story progression was smooth and did not make the movie feel too short or too long. the story's theme (life is too short, so we must value what we have) flows through several different angles and characters throughout the story. the theme is not lost during the movie and is carried by the protagonist's emotions and personal growth. the characters in this movie helped express the theme and made the film more enjoyable. puss was the perfect protagonist, and his personal growth in the movie showed the audience that it is never too late for a fresh start, especially given that his character did not transition from the last film to the beginning of this one. kitty and pedrito's contrasting personalities and feelings allow two perspectives to get through to puss and show him what it means to be a family. goldy and the three bears added an extra obstacle for 'team friendship' but highlighted the theme through their growth. death was a great character because he was simply doing his job and was the character that indirectly pushed puss to become a better person and respected him for it. jack horner was an excellent antagonist because he was indeed a villain. instead of a character that was hurt by society or had good intentions deep down, this character was a pure monster. it was refreshing to have a villain that everyone could get behind disliking. the dialogue in this movie was powerful. each sentence helped tell the story, and it did not feel like there were any filler lines. the comic relief was natural, and the emotional conversations were deep. the imagery and background in the film were well articulated and detailed. each setting aligned with the active story and flowed with the transitions. the background music of the story was also fitting; it added an extra layer for the viewer and did not distract them from the story. this movie gave hope for the future of animated movies in america."

","i have seen good movies in the year of 2022, but puss in boots: the last wish (2022) is by far the best animated movie of 2022 and is my favorite movie from that year. also, it is the best movie in the shrek franchise.the voice cast is great; antonio banderas as puss in boots was great, salma hayek was great, and harvey guill√©n as perrito was great because they are good characters, and they are funny. florence pugh as goldilocks, olivia colman as mama bear, ray winstone as papa bear, and samson kayo as baby bear were funny, and they were also good characters.there is this wolf villain in the movie that is legit creepy, was such a cool character. he does certain things that makes him a great villain for puss in boots to go against, and he is voiced by wagner moura who has a great voice for this character.the animation is beautiful in this movie; it has amazing action scenes, pretty scenery, and imaginable locations that look great in this animation style. the movie is also creative in how it uses fairytale locations and items from those stories, which is what makes another villain character voiced by john mulaney funny to watch.the movie has a simple plot but does it in a creative way with great characters, and some little references to shrek. what i especially loved was how puss in boots starts laughing in the face of danger, but because he is on his last life, he starts getting scared and starts thinking about what he has done with his earlier lives and how spent them.i had a fun time with puss in boots: the last wish (2022); it has fantastic animation, it was funny, it has great characters, it has great emotional moments, and there are great action scenes. i highly recommend checking this movie out because you will have gun with it, and i am excited to see this movie again when i get the chance."
"2167","game of thrones","jakebunker",2023-07-08,10," believe the hype
","this is the best animated feature since into the spider-verse, and probably better than toy story 4 and soul. i don't find many movies rewatchable nowadays and this is one of the few. not only is it a visual masterpiece (huge credit to the animators, well done!) but from a critical standpoint is has extremely well done characters, an engaging and relatable story, and takes very bold actions that will leave animation-lovers stunned for years to come. spoilers would be ruining an experience that you simply must witness for yourself, so what are you waiting for? believe the hype, go watch it if you haven't already! 9.5/10 but imma round up.edit: i've given it a year and came back to it and it's just even better the second viewing. in my opinion this is dreamwork's greatest movie (especially if you take away the first 5 minutes), better than kung fu panda, how to train your dragon, even prince of egypt. also the only dreamworks movie that i think deserves a 10/10. it's one thing to make an actually good and compelling story but to be also very entertaining and engaging for everyone is another feat. the user ratings and critics ratings are way too low. most criticisms of the movie are, imo, flawed, non-existent or biased. i sincerely cannot recommend this movie enough."

","this has caused quite a stir in recent days, and it's it safe to say that it eventually caught my interest. speaking for myself, i knew nothing about puss because i had never seen a single movie in the 'shrek' lineup, which sparked my curiosity even more.to prep for this allegedly wonderful sequel, i had to finish the first film first, which i did. i saw the first puss in boots movie this morning, but to my utter disappointment, it did not meet my expectations, and uncertainty worked its way in. i was worried about whether the sequel would live up to the hype.and i am pleased to report that it did. 'the last wish' may not be among the best films i have ever seen, but it is an interesting and enjoyable watch for sure.the visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the blend of two distinct animation art styles makes for an interesting cinematic experience, the score, too, sprinkled its fair share of magic, and on top of that, the characters are more fleshed out, unlike the last time, and the inclusion of 'perrito' and 'death' brought radical changes to the narrative, their mere presence made this more exciting."

and for the first time, he feels fear. after escaping by the skin of his teeth, he decides he is no longer worthy of the name puss in boots and begins life as an adopted cat. he learns about the dark forest where someone can make a wish on the wishing star. with this in mind, the crafty feline returns to adventure to get his lives back.a little late to review this movie, but i still caught it in theaters. i knew from the trailer that this would be a cool movie. at first, i was wondering why dreamworks is creating another puss in boots movie. it feels weird to make a sequel to a spin-off that came out over a decade ago. as someone who has not watched the original puss in boots, i do not think you need to watch the original to get what is going on here aside from maybe puss' relationship with kitty softpaws. with that said, let me tell you how good this movie is!puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animated films. first of all, the animation looks absolutely stunning. the movie has probably the best animation from a cgi film i have ever seen. not only do the movement and expressions look smooth and crisp, the cinematography and imagery looks amazing and memorable too. there are many awesome shots in this film such as a shot of puss staring in the eyes of death. these shots strengthen the emotional moments and even some of the funny moments as well. every shot in this movie looks awesome. the animation really shows its fluidity in the action scenes. this movie has better action than 90% percent of the live-action blockbusters out there. the set pieces are so dynamic and entertaining that there is not a boring moment in the film. the opening set piece sets the tone for the entire movie and from that point forward, i knew i was in for a ride. the soundtrack is awesome too from the catchy score to the fun opening song for puss in boots.fantastic visuals aside, the story is memorable too. this movie pushes its pg rating. there is blood, cursing and dark themes that may frighten younger viewers. the story is about how puss is reacting to the idea that he is on deaths door. if he dies one more time, he will be gone forever. this is a movie where we see one of the coolest and most confident characters in animation lose his confidence. with that, he has a character arc that gives him depths and flaws that are relatable so even when he does something kind of selfish, you can still sympathize with his motivations. this movie has a lot of stylish action and funny jokes, but the scenes revolving around the wolf ramp up the dark tone of the movie. it never loses its sense of humor and this is one funny movie. i love the snarky dialogue, perrito gets one scene with goldilocks and the three bears that steals the show comedy wise. this movie has the perfect mix of comedy, action, drama and emotional moments to make it stand out.in addition to a great story, the cast of characters are memorable too. puss is at his best. he is the same awesome and adorable character from shrek, but he is given a lot of vulnerability here. he starts out as this arrogant, but powerful guy who can take down giants, but when he sees that death is coming for him, you can see how it shakes him to the core. his friends kitty softpaws and especially perrito are great characters too. perrito seems like the guy that would annoy everyone, but he is a great support character who is hilarious and just plain adorable. he is also surprisingly aware of emotions. there is one scene with him and puss that warmed my heart.as for the antagonists, the wolf is one of my favorite antagonists in an animated film. he has a badass voice, he completely changes the tone of the movie and he wipes out puss' bravado entirely and reduces him to a frightened cat. he is also a great fighter, but it is his presence, voice, dialogue and whistle that make him truly memorable. kids might have nightmares because of him. goldilocks and the three bears are fun anti-villains that have a sweet bond with each other. then there is the gluttonous scumbag jack horner. this is the character the writers decided to just make as hilariously hatable and disgusting as possible. they make no attempt to give this guy any sympathetic trait and i love it. we need more outright terrible people in new animated films. he is a funny villain with how unapologetic he is towards his minions, but you will be actively rooting for this character's demise.every single character in this film is memorable to a degree. it helps that the voice acting in this movie is excellent with antonio banderas as puss, salma hayek as kitty, harvey gull√©n as perrito, john mulaney as jack horner and especially wagner moura as the wolf. moura might have one of the best voices for a villain in animation i have seen in a while. each person brings their character to life in this movie. i can see any main character here being someone's favorite in the movie. that is how you know that you have a great cast.there is not a dull moment in this movie. puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animation and more. i did not expect a movie like this to be that great, but when i saw the trailers with the gorgeous animation, i knew this movie was going to be a ride. i did not expect it to become one of my favorite films of 2022, but it definitely. i really hope it wins best animated feature at the academy awards this year. dreamworks deserves this one. check it out as soon as you can."

","""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a most unusual cgi film from dreamworks. this is because although kids might like it, it's clearly intended for adults. after all, the film has very strong existential elements....things that would be mostly lost on kids.this film starts with the usual self-assured heroism you would expect in a puss in boots cartoon. but then something most unusual happens...after defying death again and again, puss suddenly realizes his own mortality, as he realizes he's used up eight of his nine lives...and soon he will die once and for all! as a result, he's now afraid to be his old dashing self. so, he goes off in search of some magical wish...in the hopes that he can regain his previous lives. but, not surprisingly, along the way he discovers so much more.the animation is lovely and the story quite enjoyable. there really isn't much to complain about with this story...it's well made and hard not to like. it also is amazingly deep and unusual...not the usual vacuous sequel just made to capitalize on the original film's success."

"2178","game of thrones","huwbutts",2023-02-16,10," puts most recent movies, not just animated movies, to shame.
","in an age when movie and tv franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (i'm looking at you, disney), i don't think anyone was expecting much from puss in boots: the last wish - certainly not i.after the first 5 minutes, i knew this was something special.firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from arkane and enter the spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. the 2d elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.the music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).the dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling i think i've ever seen. in a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. the cast do a great job of selling them too. goldi and the bears come out with brilliant british-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.and then there's the wolf. this character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. his style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, i'm serious).at a time when disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - dreamworks have taken on the mantle.it made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. you might think i'm overselling it, but hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.there are those that say that hollywood is done - i know i do. but dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

-very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.adorable characters/feel
-new characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-the feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-has that element of shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.the animation
-it's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy dreamworks does so well.-the design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-the world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that i certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-and it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than disney for the blend of real and cartoons.the voice acting:
-many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that snl like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. he own the horner character and brought some of the best lines.-wagner moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the big-bad wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-pugh is okay, not my favorite role as goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. it does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-banderas takes boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the spanish stereotype. and yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.the references/jokes
-the stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of shrek.-it's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-the fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-it feels like the first two shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. again, refreshing that they were able to step back.the designs changes to an extent
-creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-like into the spiderverse? good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that puss does.-not overused, which is very good for me.the action at times
-shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-this movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-the ending fight shows the potential of what dreamworks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes i've seen this year.the heart
-lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-the movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-there are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. that's hard to do in many things.-i love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-have not felt this way since shrek 2.dislikes:the darkness
-it's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.predictable
-the lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-the movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.too many antagonists
-one of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-they do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.the comedy is still tapered
-it's starting to go back to shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made shrek, shrek.-they took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.the animation changes at times
-the animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-the comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.the action still not complete
--shrek and shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-this movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-the stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-they sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-often was shorter than i wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.the verdict
i must say, puss in boots: the last wish was a much better film than when i walked in. perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. it evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. and it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. this film is indeed a solid return to the world and i had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. however, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance i was looking for. the movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with puss in boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. and the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the shrek that we saw in the first two movies. still, i do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

","puss and boots: the last wish was a true 'feel good' movie. the plot was well thought out and transitioned flawlessly from the last puss and boots film. what made this different from the previous movie is the mature theme and sentiments that made the film enjoyable and illuminating for all ages. the story progression was smooth and did not make the movie feel too short or too long. the story's theme (life is too short, so we must value what we have) flows through several different angles and characters throughout the story. the theme is not lost during the movie and is carried by the protagonist's emotions and personal growth. the characters in this movie helped express the theme and made the film more enjoyable. puss was the perfect protagonist, and his personal growth in the movie showed the audience that it is never too late for a fresh start, especially given that his character did not transition from the last film to the beginning of this one. kitty and pedrito's contrasting personalities and feelings allow two perspectives to get through to puss and show him what it means to be a family. goldy and the three bears added an extra obstacle for 'team friendship' but highlighted the theme through their growth. death was a great character because he was simply doing his job and was the character that indirectly pushed puss to become a better person and respected him for it. jack horner was an excellent antagonist because he was indeed a villain. instead of a character that was hurt by society or had good intentions deep down, this character was a pure monster. it was refreshing to have a villain that everyone could get behind disliking. the dialogue in this movie was powerful. each sentence helped tell the story, and it did not feel like there were any filler lines. the comic relief was natural, and the emotional conversations were deep. the imagery and background in the film were well articulated and detailed. each setting aligned with the active story and flowed with the transitions. the background music of the story was also fitting; it added an extra layer for the viewer and did not distract them from the story. this movie gave hope for the future of animated movies in america."

","this is the best animated feature since into the spider-verse, and probably better than toy story 4 and soul. i don't find many movies rewatchable nowadays and this is one of the few. not only is it a visual masterpiece (huge credit to the animators, well done!) but from a critical standpoint is has extremely well done characters, an engaging and relatable story, and takes very bold actions that will leave animation-lovers stunned for years to come. spoilers would be ruining an experience that you simply must witness for yourself, so what are you waiting for? believe the hype, go watch it if you haven't already! 9.5/10 but imma round up.edit: i've given it a year and came back to it and it's just even better the second viewing. in my opinion this is dreamwork's greatest movie (especially if you take away the first 5 minutes), better than kung fu panda, how to train your dragon, even prince of egypt. also the only dreamworks movie that i think deserves a 10/10. it's one thing to make an actually good and compelling story but to be also very entertaining and engaging for everyone is another feat. the user ratings and critics ratings are way too low. most criticisms of the movie are, imo, flawed, non-existent or biased. i sincerely cannot recommend this movie enough."

","this has caused quite a stir in recent days, and it's it safe to say that it eventually caught my interest. speaking for myself, i knew nothing about puss because i had never seen a single movie in the 'shrek' lineup, which sparked my curiosity even more.to prep for this allegedly wonderful sequel, i had to finish the first film first, which i did. i saw the first puss in boots movie this morning, but to my utter disappointment, it did not meet my expectations, and uncertainty worked its way in. i was worried about whether the sequel would live up to the hype.and i am pleased to report that it did. 'the last wish' may not be among the best films i have ever seen, but it is an interesting and enjoyable watch for sure.the visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the blend of two distinct animation art styles makes for an interesting cinematic experience, the score, too, sprinkled its fair share of magic, and on top of that, the characters are more fleshed out, unlike the last time, and the inclusion of 'perrito' and 'death' brought radical changes to the narrative, their mere presence made this more exciting."
"2191","game of thrones","jaredkjacoby",2023-02-07,10," love it!
","after losing his eighth life to a bell falling on top of him, puss in boots is down to his last life. an encounter from a vicious bounty hunter with a frightening presence destroys his confidence and for the first time, he feels fear. after escaping by the skin of his teeth, he decides he is no longer worthy of the name puss in boots and begins life as an adopted cat. he learns about the dark forest where someone can make a wish on the wishing star. with this in mind, the crafty feline returns to adventure to get his lives back.a little late to review this movie, but i still caught it in theaters. i knew from the trailer that this would be a cool movie. at first, i was wondering why dreamworks is creating another puss in boots movie. it feels weird to make a sequel to a spin-off that came out over a decade ago. as someone who has not watched the original puss in boots, i do not think you need to watch the original to get what is going on here aside from maybe puss' relationship with kitty softpaws. with that said, let me tell you how good this movie is!puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animated films. first of all, the animation looks absolutely stunning. the movie has probably the best animation from a cgi film i have ever seen. not only do the movement and expressions look smooth and crisp, the cinematography and imagery looks amazing and memorable too. there are many awesome shots in this film such as a shot of puss staring in the eyes of death. these shots strengthen the emotional moments and even some of the funny moments as well. every shot in this movie looks awesome. the animation really shows its fluidity in the action scenes. this movie has better action than 90% percent of the live-action blockbusters out there. the set pieces are so dynamic and entertaining that there is not a boring moment in the film. the opening set piece sets the tone for the entire movie and from that point forward, i knew i was in for a ride. the soundtrack is awesome too from the catchy score to the fun opening song for puss in boots.fantastic visuals aside, the story is memorable too. this movie pushes its pg rating. there is blood, cursing and dark themes that may frighten younger viewers. the story is about how puss is reacting to the idea that he is on deaths door. if he dies one more time, he will be gone forever. this is a movie where we see one of the coolest and most confident characters in animation lose his confidence. with that, he has a character arc that gives him depths and flaws that are relatable so even when he does something kind of selfish, you can still sympathize with his motivations. this movie has a lot of stylish action and funny jokes, but the scenes revolving around the wolf ramp up the dark tone of the movie. it never loses its sense of humor and this is one funny movie. i love the snarky dialogue, perrito gets one scene with goldilocks and the three bears that steals the show comedy wise. this movie has the perfect mix of comedy, action, drama and emotional moments to make it stand out.in addition to a great story, the cast of characters are memorable too. puss is at his best. he is the same awesome and adorable character from shrek, but he is given a lot of vulnerability here. he starts out as this arrogant, but powerful guy who can take down giants, but when he sees that death is coming for him, you can see how it shakes him to the core. his friends kitty softpaws and especially perrito are great characters too. perrito seems like the guy that would annoy everyone, but he is a great support character who is hilarious and just plain adorable. he is also surprisingly aware of emotions. there is one scene with him and puss that warmed my heart.as for the antagonists, the wolf is one of my favorite antagonists in an animated film. he has a badass voice, he completely changes the tone of the movie and he wipes out puss' bravado entirely and reduces him to a frightened cat. he is also a great fighter, but it is his presence, voice, dialogue and whistle that make him truly memorable. kids might have nightmares because of him. goldilocks and the three bears are fun anti-villains that have a sweet bond with each other. then there is the gluttonous scumbag jack horner. this is the character the writers decided to just make as hilariously hatable and disgusting as possible. they make no attempt to give this guy any sympathetic trait and i love it. we need more outright terrible people in new animated films. he is a funny villain with how unapologetic he is towards his minions, but you will be actively rooting for this character's demise.every single character in this film is memorable to a degree. it helps that the voice acting in this movie is excellent with antonio banderas as puss, salma hayek as kitty, harvey gull√©n as perrito, john mulaney as jack horner and especially wagner moura as the wolf. moura might have one of the best voices for a villain in animation i have seen in a while. each person brings their character to life in this movie. i can see any main character here being someone's favorite in the movie. that is how you know that you have a great cast.there is not a dull moment in this movie. puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animation and more. i did not expect a movie like this to be that great, but when i saw the trailers with the gorgeous animation, i knew this movie was going to be a ride. i did not expect it to become one of my favorite films of 2022, but it definitely. i really hope it wins best animated feature at the academy awards this year. dreamworks deserves this one. check it out as soon as you can."

","in an age when movie and tv franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (i'm looking at you, disney), i don't think anyone was expecting much from puss in boots: the last wish - certainly not i.after the first 5 minutes, i knew this was something special.firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from arkane and enter the spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. the 2d elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.the music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).the dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling i think i've ever seen. in a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. the cast do a great job of selling them too. goldi and the bears come out with brilliant british-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.and then there's the wolf. this character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. his style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, i'm serious).at a time when disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - dreamworks have taken on the mantle.it made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. you might think i'm overselling it, but hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.there are those that say that hollywood is done - i know i do. but dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

-very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.adorable characters/feel
-new characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-the feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-has that element of shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.the animation
-it's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy dreamworks does so well.-the design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-the world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that i certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-and it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than disney for the blend of real and cartoons.the voice acting:
-many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that snl like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. he own the horner character and brought some of the best lines.-wagner moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the big-bad wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-pugh is okay, not my favorite role as goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. it does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-banderas takes boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the spanish stereotype. and yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.the references/jokes
-the stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of shrek.-it's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-the fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-it feels like the first two shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. again, refreshing that they were able to step back.the designs changes to an extent
-creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-like into the spiderverse? good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that puss does.-not overused, which is very good for me.the action at times
-shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-this movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-the ending fight shows the potential of what dreamworks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes i've seen this year.the heart
-lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-the movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-there are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. that's hard to do in many things.-i love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-have not felt this way since shrek 2.dislikes:the darkness
-it's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.predictable
-the lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-the movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.too many antagonists
-one of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-they do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.the comedy is still tapered
-it's starting to go back to shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made shrek, shrek.-they took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.the animation changes at times
-the animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-the comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.the action still not complete
--shrek and shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-this movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-the stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-they sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-often was shorter than i wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.the verdict
i must say, puss in boots: the last wish was a much better film than when i walked in. perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. it evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. and it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. this film is indeed a solid return to the world and i had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. however, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance i was looking for. the movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with puss in boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. and the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the shrek that we saw in the first two movies. still, i do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

","puss and boots: the last wish was a true 'feel good' movie. the plot was well thought out and transitioned flawlessly from the last puss and boots film. what made this different from the previous movie is the mature theme and sentiments that made the film enjoyable and illuminating for all ages. the story progression was smooth and did not make the movie feel too short or too long. the story's theme (life is too short, so we must value what we have) flows through several different angles and characters throughout the story. the theme is not lost during the movie and is carried by the protagonist's emotions and personal growth. the characters in this movie helped express the theme and made the film more enjoyable. puss was the perfect protagonist, and his personal growth in the movie showed the audience that it is never too late for a fresh start, especially given that his character did not transition from the last film to the beginning of this one. kitty and pedrito's contrasting personalities and feelings allow two perspectives to get through to puss and show him what it means to be a family. goldy and the three bears added an extra obstacle for 'team friendship' but highlighted the theme through their growth. death was a great character because he was simply doing his job and was the character that indirectly pushed puss to become a better person and respected him for it. jack horner was an excellent antagonist because he was indeed a villain. instead of a character that was hurt by society or had good intentions deep down, this character was a pure monster. it was refreshing to have a villain that everyone could get behind disliking. the dialogue in this movie was powerful. each sentence helped tell the story, and it did not feel like there were any filler lines. the comic relief was natural, and the emotional conversations were deep. the imagery and background in the film were well articulated and detailed. each setting aligned with the active story and flowed with the transitions. the background music of the story was also fitting; it added an extra layer for the viewer and did not distract them from the story. this movie gave hope for the future of animated movies in america."

","this film is extremely entertaining, hilarious, but also intriguing and can be genuinely intense. it has some very dark scenes and a surprising amount of violence, which is complimented by a ton of great dark humor (mostly brought on by john mulaney's character). the characters are all very well developed and fleshed out (everyone has backstories for example), many of them get satisfying archs. on the technical side, this film is incredibly animated and every frame looks gorgeous. it has a unique style on the animation that really makes this movie its own, and it doesn't feel like a rip-off of spider verse to me at all. there's a ton of detail and symbolism to analyze with this film as well, especially in the battle scenes between puss and the wolf, which have a ton of interesting details and moves (as far as a cat vs a wolf goes).i always complain about finales in animated movies being underwhelming, but this movie had an amazing finale that is not too short or too long, has some amazing battles, character archs, and satisfying moments (also the setpiece they use is awesome)this movie is great for kids and adults. it's just that good."

","puss in boots: the last wish is a sequel that wasn't asked for but that just makes it's surprisingly high quality all the better, a sequel that far exceeds the enjoyable original with a mature story about rejecting the fear of death and accepting that life is special because of its mortality.you can tell that antonio banderas loves playing this character a lot and it absolutely comes across in his voice acting. he never sounds like he's phoning it in once and still has all the charisma and energy of the character after all these years.salma hayek also has just as much energy and charm this time around and has a very natural chemistry with banderas. harvey guillen could've easily become annoying with his endless optimism but that never happens and he's just so lovable and pure.wagner moura is note perfect with an all time great animated villain whose threatening voice acting matches his characters visual look so well and is able to bring new life to a film that's already so alive whenever he's on screen.joel crawford's direction is amazing, the action sequences are so inventive and fun to watch and the lower frame rate makes them even better. the animation itself is absolutely gorgeous, so much better than what came before with a vibrancy that stuns from beginning to end as an oil painting come to life."

"2211","game of thrones","cinema-reviewer321",2023-01-08,10," the legendary puss in boots
","i have seen good movies in the year of 2022, but puss in boots: the last wish (2022) is by far the best animated movie of 2022 and is my favorite movie from that year. also, it is the best movie in the shrek franchise.the voice cast is great; antonio banderas as puss in boots was great, salma hayek was great, and harvey guill√©n as perrito was great because they are good characters, and they are funny. florence pugh as goldilocks, olivia colman as mama bear, ray winstone as papa bear, and samson kayo as baby bear were funny, and they were also good characters.there is this wolf villain in the movie that is legit creepy, was such a cool character. he does certain things that makes him a great villain for puss in boots to go against, and he is voiced by wagner moura who has a great voice for this character.the animation is beautiful in this movie; it has amazing action scenes, pretty scenery, and imaginable locations that look great in this animation style. the movie is also creative in how it uses fairytale locations and items from those stories, which is what makes another villain character voiced by john mulaney funny to watch.the movie has a simple plot but does it in a creative way with great characters, and some little references to shrek. what i especially loved was how puss in boots starts laughing in the face of danger, but because he is on his last life, he starts getting scared and starts thinking about what he has done with his earlier lives and how spent them.i had a fun time with puss in boots: the last wish (2022); it has fantastic animation, it was funny, it has great characters, it has great emotional moments, and there are great action scenes. i highly recommend checking this movie out because you will have gun with it, and i am excited to see this movie again when i get the chance."
"2212","game of thrones","jakebunker",2023-07-08,10," believe the hype
","this is the best animated feature since into the spider-verse, and probably better than toy story 4 and soul. i don't find many movies rewatchable nowadays and this is one of the few. not only is it a visual masterpiece (huge credit to the animators, well done!) but from a critical standpoint is has extremely well done characters, an engaging and relatable story, and takes very bold actions that will leave animation-lovers stunned for years to come. spoilers would be ruining an experience that you simply must witness for yourself, so what are you waiting for? believe the hype, go watch it if you haven't already! 9.5/10 but imma round up.edit: i've given it a year and came back to it and it's just even better the second viewing. in my opinion this is dreamwork's greatest movie (especially if you take away the first 5 minutes), better than kung fu panda, how to train your dragon, even prince of egypt. also the only dreamworks movie that i think deserves a 10/10. it's one thing to make an actually good and compelling story but to be also very entertaining and engaging for everyone is another feat. the user ratings and critics ratings are way too low. most criticisms of the movie are, imo, flawed, non-existent or biased. i sincerely cannot recommend this movie enough."
"2213","game of thrones","soumikbanerjee1996",2023-01-12,8," one darn good entertainer!
","this has caused quite a stir in recent days, and it's it safe to say that it eventually caught my interest. speaking for myself, i knew nothing about puss because i had never seen a single movie in the 'shrek' lineup, which sparked my curiosity even more.to prep for this allegedly wonderful sequel, i had to finish the first film first, which i did. i saw the first puss in boots movie this morning, but to my utter disappointment, it did not meet my expectations, and uncertainty worked its way in. i was worried about whether the sequel would live up to the hype.and i am pleased to report that it did. 'the last wish' may not be among the best films i have ever seen, but it is an interesting and enjoyable watch for sure.the visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the blend of two distinct animation art styles makes for an interesting cinematic experience, the score, too, sprinkled its fair share of magic, and on top of that, the characters are more fleshed out, unlike the last time, and the inclusion of 'perrito' and 'death' brought radical changes to the narrative, their mere presence made this more exciting."
"2214","game of thrones","jaredkjacoby",2023-02-07,10," love it!
","after losing his eighth life to a bell falling on top of him, puss in boots is down to his last life. an encounter from a vicious bounty hunter with a frightening presence destroys his confidence and for the first time, he feels fear. after escaping by the skin of his teeth, he decides he is no longer worthy of the name puss in boots and begins life as an adopted cat. he learns about the dark forest where someone can make a wish on the wishing star. with this in mind, the crafty feline returns to adventure to get his lives back.a little late to review this movie, but i still caught it in theaters. i knew from the trailer that this would be a cool movie. at first, i was wondering why dreamworks is creating another puss in boots movie. it feels weird to make a sequel to a spin-off that came out over a decade ago. as someone who has not watched the original puss in boots, i do not think you need to watch the original to get what is going on here aside from maybe puss' relationship with kitty softpaws. with that said, let me tell you how good this movie is!puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animated films. first of all, the animation looks absolutely stunning. the movie has probably the best animation from a cgi film i have ever seen. not only do the movement and expressions look smooth and crisp, the cinematography and imagery looks amazing and memorable too. there are many awesome shots in this film such as a shot of puss staring in the eyes of death. these shots strengthen the emotional moments and even some of the funny moments as well. every shot in this movie looks awesome. the animation really shows its fluidity in the action scenes. this movie has better action than 90% percent of the live-action blockbusters out there. the set pieces are so dynamic and entertaining that there is not a boring moment in the film. the opening set piece sets the tone for the entire movie and from that point forward, i knew i was in for a ride. the soundtrack is awesome too from the catchy score to the fun opening song for puss in boots.fantastic visuals aside, the story is memorable too. this movie pushes its pg rating. there is blood, cursing and dark themes that may frighten younger viewers. the story is about how puss is reacting to the idea that he is on deaths door. if he dies one more time, he will be gone forever. this is a movie where we see one of the coolest and most confident characters in animation lose his confidence. with that, he has a character arc that gives him depths and flaws that are relatable so even when he does something kind of selfish, you can still sympathize with his motivations. this movie has a lot of stylish action and funny jokes, but the scenes revolving around the wolf ramp up the dark tone of the movie. it never loses its sense of humor and this is one funny movie. i love the snarky dialogue, perrito gets one scene with goldilocks and the three bears that steals the show comedy wise. this movie has the perfect mix of comedy, action, drama and emotional moments to make it stand out.in addition to a great story, the cast of characters are memorable too. puss is at his best. he is the same awesome and adorable character from shrek, but he is given a lot of vulnerability here. he starts out as this arrogant, but powerful guy who can take down giants, but when he sees that death is coming for him, you can see how it shakes him to the core. his friends kitty softpaws and especially perrito are great characters too. perrito seems like the guy that would annoy everyone, but he is a great support character who is hilarious and just plain adorable. he is also surprisingly aware of emotions. there is one scene with him and puss that warmed my heart.as for the antagonists, the wolf is one of my favorite antagonists in an animated film. he has a badass voice, he completely changes the tone of the movie and he wipes out puss' bravado entirely and reduces him to a frightened cat. he is also a great fighter, but it is his presence, voice, dialogue and whistle that make him truly memorable. kids might have nightmares because of him. goldilocks and the three bears are fun anti-villains that have a sweet bond with each other. then there is the gluttonous scumbag jack horner. this is the character the writers decided to just make as hilariously hatable and disgusting as possible. they make no attempt to give this guy any sympathetic trait and i love it. we need more outright terrible people in new animated films. he is a funny villain with how unapologetic he is towards his minions, but you will be actively rooting for this character's demise.every single character in this film is memorable to a degree. it helps that the voice acting in this movie is excellent with antonio banderas as puss, salma hayek as kitty, harvey gull√©n as perrito, john mulaney as jack horner and especially wagner moura as the wolf. moura might have one of the best voices for a villain in animation i have seen in a while. each person brings their character to life in this movie. i can see any main character here being someone's favorite in the movie. that is how you know that you have a great cast.there is not a dull moment in this movie. puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animation and more. i did not expect a movie like this to be that great, but when i saw the trailers with the gorgeous animation, i knew this movie was going to be a ride. i did not expect it to become one of my favorite films of 2022, but it definitely. i really hope it wins best animated feature at the academy awards this year. dreamworks deserves this one. check it out as soon as you can."

","in an age when movie and tv franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (i'm looking at you, disney), i don't think anyone was expecting much from puss in boots: the last wish - certainly not i.after the first 5 minutes, i knew this was something special.firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from arkane and enter the spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. the 2d elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.the music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).the dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling i think i've ever seen. in a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. the cast do a great job of selling them too. goldi and the bears come out with brilliant british-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.and then there's the wolf. this character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. his style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, i'm serious).at a time when disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - dreamworks have taken on the mantle.it made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. you might think i'm overselling it, but hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.there are those that say that hollywood is done - i know i do. but dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

-is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.adorable characters/feel
-new characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-the feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-has that element of shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.the animation
-it's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy dreamworks does so well.-the design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-the world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that i certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-and it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than disney for the blend of real and cartoons.the voice acting:
-many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that snl like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. he own the horner character and brought some of the best lines.-wagner moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the big-bad wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-pugh is okay, not my favorite role as goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. it does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-banderas takes boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the spanish stereotype. and yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.the references/jokes
-the stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of shrek.-it's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-the fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-it feels like the first two shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. again, refreshing that they were able to step back.the designs changes to an extent
-creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-like into the spiderverse? good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that puss does.-not overused, which is very good for me.the action at times
-shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-this movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-the ending fight shows the potential of what dreamworks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes i've seen this year.the heart
-lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-the movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-there are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. that's hard to do in many things.-i love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-have not felt this way since shrek 2.dislikes:the darkness
-it's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.predictable
-the lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-the movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.too many antagonists
-one of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-they do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.the comedy is still tapered
-it's starting to go back to shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made shrek, shrek.-they took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.the animation changes at times
-the animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-the comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.the action still not complete
--shrek and shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-this movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-the stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-they sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-often was shorter than i wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.the verdict
i must say, puss in boots: the last wish was a much better film than when i walked in. perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. it evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. and it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. this film is indeed a solid return to the world and i had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. however, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance i was looking for. the movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with puss in boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. and the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the shrek that we saw in the first two movies. still, i do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

"2231","game of thrones","wolfinflannel",2023-10-21,10," restored my faith in animated movies!
","puss and boots: the last wish was a true 'feel good' movie. the plot was well thought out and transitioned flawlessly from the last puss and boots film. what made this different from the previous movie is the mature theme and sentiments that made the film enjoyable and illuminating for all ages. the story progression was smooth and did not make the movie feel too short or too long. the story's theme (life is too short, so we must value what we have) flows through several different angles and characters throughout the story. the theme is not lost during the movie and is carried by the protagonist's emotions and personal growth. the characters in this movie helped express the theme and made the film more enjoyable. puss was the perfect protagonist, and his personal growth in the movie showed the audience that it is never too late for a fresh start, especially given that his character did not transition from the last film to the beginning of this one. kitty and pedrito's contrasting personalities and feelings allow two perspectives to get through to puss and show him what it means to be a family. goldy and the three bears added an extra obstacle for 'team friendship' but highlighted the theme through their growth. death was a great character because he was simply doing his job and was the character that indirectly pushed puss to become a better person and respected him for it. jack horner was an excellent antagonist because he was indeed a villain. instead of a character that was hurt by society or had good intentions deep down, this character was a pure monster. it was refreshing to have a villain that everyone could get behind disliking. the dialogue in this movie was powerful. each sentence helped tell the story, and it did not feel like there were any filler lines. the comic relief was natural, and the emotional conversations were deep. the imagery and background in the film were well articulated and detailed. each setting aligned with the active story and flowed with the transitions. the background music of the story was also fitting; it added an extra layer for the viewer and did not distract them from the story. this movie gave hope for the future of animated movies in america."

"2236","game of thrones","cinema-reviewer321",2023-01-08,10," the legendary puss in boots
","i have seen good movies in the year of 2022, but puss in boots: the last wish (2022) is by far the best animated movie of 2022 and is my favorite movie from that year. also, it is the best movie in the shrek franchise.the voice cast is great; antonio banderas as puss in boots was great, salma hayek was great, and harvey guill√©n as perrito was great because they are good characters, and they are funny. florence pugh as goldilocks, olivia colman as mama bear, ray winstone as papa bear, and samson kayo as baby bear were funny, and they were also good characters.there is this wolf villain in the movie that is legit creepy, was such a cool character. he does certain things that makes him a great villain for puss in boots to go against, and he is voiced by wagner moura who has a great voice for this character.the animation is beautiful in this movie; it has amazing action scenes, pretty scenery, and imaginable locations that look great in this animation style. the movie is also creative in how it uses fairytale locations and items from those stories, which is what makes another villain character voiced by john mulaney funny to watch.the movie has a simple plot but does it in a creative way with great characters, and some little references to shrek. what i especially loved was how puss in boots starts laughing in the face of danger, but because he is on his last life, he starts getting scared and starts thinking about what he has done with his earlier lives and how spent them.i had a fun time with puss in boots: the last wish (2022); it has fantastic animation, it was funny, it has great characters, it has great emotional moments, and there are great action scenes. i highly recommend checking this movie out because you will have gun with it, and i am excited to see this movie again when i get the chance."
"2237","game of thrones","jakebunker",2023-07-08,10," believe the hype
","this is the best animated feature since into the spider-verse, and probably better than toy story 4 and soul. i don't find many movies rewatchable nowadays and this is one of the few. not only is it a visual masterpiece (huge credit to the animators, well done!) but from a critical standpoint is has extremely well done characters, an engaging and relatable story, and takes very bold actions that will leave animation-lovers stunned for years to come. spoilers would be ruining an experience that you simply must witness for yourself, so what are you waiting for? believe the hype, go watch it if you haven't already! 9.5/10 but imma round up.edit: i've given it a year and came back to it and it's just even better the second viewing. in my opinion this is dreamwork's greatest movie (especially if you take away the first 5 minutes), better than kung fu panda, how to train your dragon, even prince of egypt. also the only dreamworks movie that i think deserves a 10/10. it's one thing to make an actually good and compelling story but to be also very entertaining and engaging for everyone is another feat. the user ratings and critics ratings are way too low. most criticisms of the movie are, imo, flawed, non-existent or biased. i sincerely cannot recommend this movie enough."

'the last wish' may not be among the best films i have ever seen, but it is an interesting and enjoyable watch for sure.the visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the blend of two distinct animation art styles makes for an interesting cinematic experience, the score, too, sprinkled its fair share of magic, and on top of that, the characters are more fleshed out, unlike the last time, and the inclusion of 'perrito' and 'death' brought radical changes to the narrative, their mere presence made this more exciting."
"2239","game of thrones","jaredkjacoby",2023-02-07,10," love it!
","after losing his eighth life to a bell falling on top of him, puss in boots is down to his last life. an encounter from a vicious bounty hunter with a frightening presence destroys his confidence and for the first time, he feels fear. after escaping by the skin of his teeth, he decides he is no longer worthy of the name puss in boots and begins life as an adopted cat. he learns about the dark forest where someone can make a wish on the wishing star. with this in mind, the crafty feline returns to adventure to get his lives back.a little late to review this movie, but i still caught it in theaters. i knew from the trailer that this would be a cool movie. at first, i was wondering why dreamworks is creating another puss in boots movie. it feels weird to make a sequel to a spin-off that came out over a decade ago. as someone who has not watched the original puss in boots, i do not think you need to watch the original to get what is going on here aside from maybe puss' relationship with kitty softpaws. with that said, let me tell you how good this movie is!puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animated films. first of all, the animation looks absolutely stunning. the movie has probably the best animation from a cgi film i have ever seen. not only do the movement and expressions look smooth and crisp, the cinematography and imagery looks amazing and memorable too. there are many awesome shots in this film such as a shot of puss staring in the eyes of death. these shots strengthen the emotional moments and even some of the funny moments as well. every shot in this movie looks awesome. the animation really shows its fluidity in the action scenes. this movie has better action than 90% percent of the live-action blockbusters out there. the set pieces are so dynamic and entertaining that there is not a boring moment in the film. the opening set piece sets the tone for the entire movie and from that point forward, i knew i was in for a ride. the soundtrack is awesome too from the catchy score to the fun opening song for puss in boots.fantastic visuals aside, the story is memorable too. this movie pushes its pg rating. there is blood, cursing and dark themes that may frighten younger viewers. the story is about how puss is reacting to the idea that he is on deaths door. if he dies one more time, he will be gone forever. this is a movie where we see one of the coolest and most confident characters in animation lose his confidence. with that, he has a character arc that gives him depths and flaws that are relatable so even when he does something kind of selfish, you can still sympathize with his motivations. this movie has a lot of stylish action and funny jokes, but the scenes revolving around the wolf ramp up the dark tone of the movie. it never loses its sense of humor and this is one funny movie. i love the snarky dialogue, perrito gets one scene with goldilocks and the three bears that steals the show comedy wise. this movie has the perfect mix of comedy, action, drama and emotional moments to make it stand out.in addition to a great story, the cast of characters are memorable too. puss is at his best. he is the same awesome and adorable character from shrek, but he is given a lot of vulnerability here. he starts out as this arrogant, but powerful guy who can take down giants, but when he sees that death is coming for him, you can see how it shakes him to the core. his friends kitty softpaws and especially perrito are great characters too. perrito seems like the guy that would annoy everyone, but he is a great support character who is hilarious and just plain adorable. he is also surprisingly aware of emotions. there is one scene with him and puss that warmed my heart.as for the antagonists, the wolf is one of my favorite antagonists in an animated film. he has a badass voice, he completely changes the tone of the movie and he wipes out puss' bravado entirely and reduces him to a frightened cat. he is also a great fighter, but it is his presence, voice, dialogue and whistle that make him truly memorable. kids might have nightmares because of him. goldilocks and the three bears are fun anti-villains that have a sweet bond with each other. then there is the gluttonous scumbag jack horner. this is the character the writers decided to just make as hilariously hatable and disgusting as possible. they make no attempt to give this guy any sympathetic trait and i love it. we need more outright terrible people in new animated films. he is a funny villain with how unapologetic he is towards his minions, but you will be actively rooting for this character's demise.every single character in this film is memorable to a degree. it helps that the voice acting in this movie is excellent with antonio banderas as puss, salma hayek as kitty, harvey gull√©n as perrito, john mulaney as jack horner and especially wagner moura as the wolf. moura might have one of the best voices for a villain in animation i have seen in a while. each person brings their character to life in this movie. i can see any main character here being someone's favorite in the movie. that is how you know that you have a great cast.there is not a dull moment in this movie. puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animation and more. i did not expect a movie like this to be that great, but when i saw the trailers with the gorgeous animation, i knew this movie was going to be a ride. i did not expect it to become one of my favorite films of 2022, but it definitely. i really hope it wins best animated feature at the academy awards this year. dreamworks deserves this one. check it out as soon as you can."

","in an age when movie and tv franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (i'm looking at you, disney), i don't think anyone was expecting much from puss in boots: the last wish - certainly not i.after the first 5 minutes, i knew this was something special.firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from arkane and enter the spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. the 2d elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.the music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).the dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling i think i've ever seen. in a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. the cast do a great job of selling them too. goldi and the bears come out with brilliant british-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.and then there's the wolf. this character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. his style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, i'm serious).at a time when disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - dreamworks have taken on the mantle.it made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. you might think i'm overselling it, but hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.there are those that say that hollywood is done - i know i do. but dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

","you heard me! my wife and i just got back from the theater, and absolutely loved this movie, even more than any of the shrek movies and the first puss in boots!this movie has so much to love, from beautiful visuals/action to consistent humor that actually had us laughing to engaging characters, both old and new. such a fun time, and so worth seeing in the theaters, though we'll definitely be picking up a copy once it's out on dvd!without giving too much away, there are several different antagonists in this movie that scratch all the bad-guy itches, covering the spectrum from totally hateable to horrifying to relatable and sympathetic. a great cast! also, the magical world they came up with for this movie was awesome, with some really cool/unique features!at first, we were a little worried about the dog character, neither of us being big fans of daffy sidekicks, but we were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves rooting for him! he's hilarious, and that's coming from a cat-lover!several callbacks to the first puss in boots movie made this one feel less like a spin-off than a worthy standalone franchise, and the movie was packed with magical references that all ages will be able to recognize and enjoy.do yourself a favor and free a few hours for this one!! a rare 10 from me!!"

","likes:pacing
-very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.adorable characters/feel
-new characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-the feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-has that element of shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.the animation
-it's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy dreamworks does so well.-the design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-the world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that i certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-and it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than disney for the blend of real and cartoons.the voice acting:
-many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that snl like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. he own the horner character and brought some of the best lines.-wagner moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the big-bad wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-pugh is okay, not my favorite role as goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. it does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-banderas takes boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the spanish stereotype. and yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.the references/jokes
-the stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of shrek.-it's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-the fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-it feels like the first two shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. again, refreshing that they were able to step back.the designs changes to an extent
-creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-like into the spiderverse? good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that puss does.-not overused, which is very good for me.the action at times
-shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-this movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-the ending fight shows the potential of what dreamworks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes i've seen this year.the heart
-lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-the movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-there are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. that's hard to do in many things.-i love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-have not felt this way since shrek 2.dislikes:the darkness
-it's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.predictable
-the lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-the movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.too many antagonists
-one of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-they do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.the comedy is still tapered
-it's starting to go back to shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made shrek, shrek.-they took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.the animation changes at times
-the animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-the comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.the action still not complete
--shrek and shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-this movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-the stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-they sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-often was shorter than i wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.the verdict
i must say, puss in boots: the last wish was a much better film than when i walked in. perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. it evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. and it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. this film is indeed a solid return to the world and i had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. however, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance i was looking for. the movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with puss in boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. and the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the shrek that we saw in the first two movies. still, i do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

"2256","game of thrones","wolfinflannel",2023-10-21,10," restored my faith in animated movies!
","puss and boots: the last wish was a true 'feel good' movie. the plot was well thought out and transitioned flawlessly from the last puss and boots film. what made this different from the previous movie is the mature theme and sentiments that made the film enjoyable and illuminating for all ages. the story progression was smooth and did not make the movie feel too short or too long. the story's theme (life is too short, so we must value what we have) flows through several different angles and characters throughout the story. the theme is not lost during the movie and is carried by the protagonist's emotions and personal growth. the characters in this movie helped express the theme and made the film more enjoyable. puss was the perfect protagonist, and his personal growth in the movie showed the audience that it is never too late for a fresh start, especially given that his character did not transition from the last film to the beginning of this one. kitty and pedrito's contrasting personalities and feelings allow two perspectives to get through to puss and show him what it means to be a family. goldy and the three bears added an extra obstacle for 'team friendship' but highlighted the theme through their growth. death was a great character because he was simply doing his job and was the character that indirectly pushed puss to become a better person and respected him for it. jack horner was an excellent antagonist because he was indeed a villain. instead of a character that was hurt by society or had good intentions deep down, this character was a pure monster. it was refreshing to have a villain that everyone could get behind disliking. the dialogue in this movie was powerful. each sentence helped tell the story, and it did not feel like there were any filler lines. the comic relief was natural, and the emotional conversations were deep. the imagery and background in the film were well articulated and detailed. each setting aligned with the active story and flowed with the transitions. the background music of the story was also fitting; it added an extra layer for the viewer and did not distract them from the story. this movie gave hope for the future of animated movies in america."

","i have seen good movies in the year of 2022, but puss in boots: the last wish (2022) is by far the best animated movie of 2022 and is my favorite movie from that year. also, it is the best movie in the shrek franchise.the voice cast is great; antonio banderas as puss in boots was great, salma hayek was great, and harvey guill√©n as perrito was great because they are good characters, and they are funny. florence pugh as goldilocks, olivia colman as mama bear, ray winstone as papa bear, and samson kayo as baby bear were funny, and they were also good characters.there is this wolf villain in the movie that is legit creepy, was such a cool character. he does certain things that makes him a great villain for puss in boots to go against, and he is voiced by wagner moura who has a great voice for this character.the animation is beautiful in this movie; it has amazing action scenes, pretty scenery, and imaginable locations that look great in this animation style. the movie is also creative in how it uses fairytale locations and items from those stories, which is what makes another villain character voiced by john mulaney funny to watch.the movie has a simple plot but does it in a creative way with great characters, and some little references to shrek. what i especially loved was how puss in boots starts laughing in the face of danger, but because he is on his last life, he starts getting scared and starts thinking about what he has done with his earlier lives and how spent them.i had a fun time with puss in boots: the last wish (2022); it has fantastic animation, it was funny, it has great characters, it has great emotional moments, and there are great action scenes. i highly recommend checking this movie out because you will have gun with it, and i am excited to see this movie again when i get the chance."

'the last wish' may not be among the best films i have ever seen, but it is an interesting and enjoyable watch for sure.the visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the blend of two distinct animation art styles makes for an interesting cinematic experience, the score, too, sprinkled its fair share of magic, and on top of that, the characters are more fleshed out, unlike the last time, and the inclusion of 'perrito' and 'death' brought radical changes to the narrative, their mere presence made this more exciting."

","after losing his eighth life to a bell falling on top of him, puss in boots is down to his last life. an encounter from a vicious bounty hunter with a frightening presence destroys his confidence and for the first time, he feels fear. after escaping by the skin of his teeth, he decides he is no longer worthy of the name puss in boots and begins life as an adopted cat. he learns about the dark forest where someone can make a wish on the wishing star. with this in mind, the crafty feline returns to adventure to get his lives back.a little late to review this movie, but i still caught it in theaters. i knew from the trailer that this would be a cool movie. at first, i was wondering why dreamworks is creating another puss in boots movie. it feels weird to make a sequel to a spin-off that came out over a decade ago. as someone who has not watched the original puss in boots, i do not think you need to watch the original to get what is going on here aside from maybe puss' relationship with kitty softpaws. with that said, let me tell you how good this movie is!puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animated films. first of all, the animation looks absolutely stunning. the movie has probably the best animation from a cgi film i have ever seen. not only do the movement and expressions look smooth and crisp, the cinematography and imagery looks amazing and memorable too. there are many awesome shots in this film such as a shot of puss staring in the eyes of death. these shots strengthen the emotional moments and even some of the funny moments as well. every shot in this movie looks awesome. the animation really shows its fluidity in the action scenes. this movie has better action than 90% percent of the live-action blockbusters out there. the set pieces are so dynamic and entertaining that there is not a boring moment in the film. the opening set piece sets the tone for the entire movie and from that point forward, i knew i was in for a ride. the soundtrack is awesome too from the catchy score to the fun opening song for puss in boots.fantastic visuals aside, the story is memorable too. this movie pushes its pg rating. there is blood, cursing and dark themes that may frighten younger viewers. the story is about how puss is reacting to the idea that he is on deaths door. if he dies one more time, he will be gone forever. this is a movie where we see one of the coolest and most confident characters in animation lose his confidence. with that, he has a character arc that gives him depths and flaws that are relatable so even when he does something kind of selfish, you can still sympathize with his motivations. this movie has a lot of stylish action and funny jokes, but the scenes revolving around the wolf ramp up the dark tone of the movie. it never loses its sense of humor and this is one funny movie. i love the snarky dialogue, perrito gets one scene with goldilocks and the three bears that steals the show comedy wise. this movie has the perfect mix of comedy, action, drama and emotional moments to make it stand out.in addition to a great story, the cast of characters are memorable too. puss is at his best. he is the same awesome and adorable character from shrek, but he is given a lot of vulnerability here. he starts out as this arrogant, but powerful guy who can take down giants, but when he sees that death is coming for him, you can see how it shakes him to the core. his friends kitty softpaws and especially perrito are great characters too. perrito seems like the guy that would annoy everyone, but he is a great support character who is hilarious and just plain adorable. he is also surprisingly aware of emotions. there is one scene with him and puss that warmed my heart.as for the antagonists, the wolf is one of my favorite antagonists in an animated film. he has a badass voice, he completely changes the tone of the movie and he wipes out puss' bravado entirely and reduces him to a frightened cat. he is also a great fighter, but it is his presence, voice, dialogue and whistle that make him truly memorable. kids might have nightmares because of him. goldilocks and the three bears are fun anti-villains that have a sweet bond with each other. then there is the gluttonous scumbag jack horner. this is the character the writers decided to just make as hilariously hatable and disgusting as possible. they make no attempt to give this guy any sympathetic trait and i love it. we need more outright terrible people in new animated films. he is a funny villain with how unapologetic he is towards his minions, but you will be actively rooting for this character's demise.every single character in this film is memorable to a degree. it helps that the voice acting in this movie is excellent with antonio banderas as puss, salma hayek as kitty, harvey gull√©n as perrito, john mulaney as jack horner and especially wagner moura as the wolf. moura might have one of the best voices for a villain in animation i have seen in a while. each person brings their character to life in this movie. i can see any main character here being someone's favorite in the movie. that is how you know that you have a great cast.there is not a dull moment in this movie. puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animation and more. i did not expect a movie like this to be that great, but when i saw the trailers with the gorgeous animation, i knew this movie was going to be a ride. i did not expect it to become one of my favorite films of 2022, but it definitely. i really hope it wins best animated feature at the academy awards this year. dreamworks deserves this one. check it out as soon as you can."

","it doesn't take long to realist that there is nothing particularly original in the plot of this movie. more or less from the outset it promises to be a more debauched, british version of the talented mr ripley, and ultimately it never strays too far from that tag.having thus tempered expectations, there is enough in the first hour or so of this film to offer some encouragement that the film could at least be watchable.our protagonist oliver (barry keoghan) is a scholarship boy at oxford. initially ostracised from the in-crowd by his lack of wealth or social grace, he works his way into the orbit of the charming, dashing and rich felix (jacob elordi), and is ultimately invited to the titular family home. there he is introduced to the bizarre world of the british aristocracy and the idiosyncratic characters that populate it.having established this fish-out-of-water narrative, and despite the sterling efforts of its cast, the plot then begins to drift. we are offered glimpses of what might have been - the relationship between oliver and felix's sister venetia (alison oliver), in particular, briefly offers opportunity for real interest and intrigue - but the film eschews these in favour of a far more well-worn and unchallenging path.as a consequence, the second half of the film - which is written to be rich in twists, reveals and shocks - becomes bland, predictable and - frankly - boring.there are strong performances throughout the film - rosamund pike, as felix's mother, is particularly engaging and amusing, and attempts admirably to carry much of the second half of the film. jacob elordi, though slightly unconvincing as a british aristocrat, looks nevertheless to have a bright future ahead of him. richard e. grant, as felix's father, is good value as well, even if his character is a little one-dimensional.and there are interesting characters who are never properly explored. pamela (carey mulligan) is a guest at saltburn who has overstayed her welcome, but is discarded as swiftly as she is introduced. farleigh (archie madekwe) is oliver's rival for felix's attention and funding, and provides a character that is well-drawn, well-performed and interesting, but again disappears from view in the latter stages of the film. this is particularly disappointing as archie madekwe does a great job of balancing his character's contradictions: intellectual but belligerent, confident but desperate, charming but hostile.the final result has some strong moments and some good performances, but ultimately fails to develop into a worthy film. at 2 hours and 7 minutes in length, it feels at least half an hour too long, and i confess it was ultimately a relief to finally be able to leave the cinema."

"2280","game of thrones","ferguson-6",2023-11-21,7," happy castle dance
","greetings again from the darkness. emerald fennell won an oscar for her original screenplay of her dark and divisive debut feature film, promising young woman (2020). she's back as writer-director of her second feature film, and it's every bit as dark, and even more scathing in its takedown of the rich and entitled. we are also treated to yet another awkwardly disturbed character for the growing resume of barry keoghan.oliver quick (keoghan) is a newly arrived student of the class of 2006 at oxford, and it's clear from the first moment that he doesn't really fit in, whether it's his clothes, not smoking, his uneasiness with his tutor, or his social ineptness. he becomes transfixed on the bmoc, felix catton (jacob elordi, fresh off his turn as elvis in priscilla). felix is tall, handsome, charming, and rich. life comes easy for him, and students are drawn to him - both male and female. he's a modern-day aristocrat, and one day oliver helps him out of a jam. this leads to a bonding, or more like worlds colliding. the first act is devoted to the development of this unexpected friendship, and leads to felix inviting oliver to spend the summer at his family estate ... saltburn.saltburn is nothing short of a magnificent castle. felix's eccentric family includes farleigh (archie madekwe, gran turismo), an adopted ""cousin"" fellow oxfor student who sees all but would never blow this gig; venetia (alison oliver), the total mess of a daughter and sister; poor dear pamela (carey mulligan), the total mess of a houseguest who has overstayed her welcome; sir james catton (richard e grant), the childlike father; and espeth catton (rosamund pike), the former model drama queen passive-aggressive mother. it's a motley crew that puts 'the royal tenenbaums' to shame for entitlement.as the summer progresses, we see oliver in action as he weasels his way into the good graces of some, while creating leverage over others. his non-descript looks, quiet demeanor, and background story lead some to protect him at the same time others distrust him. as viewers, it's obvious to us that something isn't right with oliver, yet director fennell and keoghan's performance keeps us hopeful that things won't become too skewed. those hopes are dashed once we see keoghan's first bathtub scene (and subsequent disturbing moments), and fennell serves up multiple references to his mouth in letting us know it's not to be trusted.the third act goes full dark in a deliciously wicked manner with fennell and oscar winning cinematographer linus sandgren (la la land) creating an old world style within a contemporary world. the film is perfectly cast with elordi quite magnetic as felix, the not-so-obscure object of oliver's desire. madekwe is spot on as the turf-protecting farleigh, and grant and pike make the perfectly mismatched couple of privilege. alison oliver delivers the film's best scene with her bathtub monologue, while keoghan nails the creepy oliver (in line with his roles in the banshees of inisherin, the killing of a sacred deer, and the batman. he has become the go-to psychopath. he even combines humor and horror for his happy naked castle dance in this film that has the talented mr ripley (1999) as its most obvious comparison. ms. fennell strikes another blow against the entitled elite, although we do wish she hadn't spelled out everything to end the film ... a bit of mystique would have worked.opening in theaters on november 22, 2023."

","greetings again from the darkness. emerald fennell won an oscar for her original screenplay of her dark and divisive debut feature film, promising young woman (2020). she's back as writer-director of her second feature film, and it's every bit as dark, and even more scathing in its takedown of the rich and entitled. we are also treated to yet another awkwardly disturbed character for the growing resume of barry keoghan.oliver quick (keoghan) is a newly arrived student of the class of 2006 at oxford, and it's clear from the first moment that he doesn't really fit in, whether it's his clothes, not smoking, his uneasiness with his tutor, or his social ineptness. he becomes transfixed on the bmoc, felix catton (jacob elordi, fresh off his turn as elvis in priscilla). felix is tall, handsome, charming, and rich. life comes easy for him, and students are drawn to him - both male and female. he's a modern-day aristocrat, and one day oliver helps him out of a jam. this leads to a bonding, or more like worlds colliding. the first act is devoted to the development of this unexpected friendship, and leads to felix inviting oliver to spend the summer at his family estate ... saltburn.saltburn is nothing short of a magnificent castle. felix's eccentric family includes farleigh (archie madekwe, gran turismo), an adopted ""cousin"" fellow oxfor student who sees all but would never blow this gig; venetia (alison oliver), the total mess of a daughter and sister; poor dear pamela (carey mulligan), the total mess of a houseguest who has overstayed her welcome; sir james catton (richard e grant), the childlike father; and espeth catton (rosamund pike), the former model drama queen passive-aggressive mother. it's a motley crew that puts 'the royal tenenbaums' to shame for entitlement.as the summer progresses, we see oliver in action as he weasels his way into the good graces of some, while creating leverage over others. his non-descript looks, quiet demeanor, and background story lead some to protect him at the same time others distrust him. as viewers, it's obvious to us that something isn't right with oliver, yet director fennell and keoghan's performance keeps us hopeful that things won't become too skewed. those hopes are dashed once we see keoghan's first bathtub scene (and subsequent disturbing moments), and fennell serves up multiple references to his mouth in letting us know it's not to be trusted.the third act goes full dark in a deliciously wicked manner with fennell and oscar winning cinematographer linus sandgren (la la land) creating an old world style within a contemporary world. the film is perfectly cast with elordi quite magnetic as felix, the not-so-obscure object of oliver's desire. madekwe is spot on as the turf-protecting farleigh, and grant and pike make the perfectly mismatched couple of privilege. alison oliver delivers the film's best scene with her bathtub monologue, while keoghan nails the creepy oliver (in line with his roles in the banshees of inisherin, the killing of a sacred deer, and the batman. he has become the go-to psychopath. he even combines humor and horror for his happy naked castle dance in this film that has the talented mr ripley (1999) as its most obvious comparison. ms. fennell strikes another blow against the entitled elite, although we do wish she hadn't spelled out everything to end the film ... a bit of mystique would have worked.opening in theaters on november 22, 2023."

""saltburn"" absolutely delivered the thrills, laughs, weirdness, sexiness, eeriness, and stylish personality that the first film encompasses but double downs on it tenfold. it is a very british psychological thriller with plenty of charm, youthful energy, and originality. the early 2000s aesthetic is lush and on point. i truly believe that this film utilizes the so-called 'eat the rich' narrative perfectly, and is easily the best film of that genre. the film is kind of a cross between jordan peele's ""get out"" and mike white's ""the white lotus"". i need the film's soundtrack like yesterday. i have nothing but undying respect, gratitude, and praise for filmmaker emerald fennell. ""saltburn"" is one of the best films of the year. bravo to all involved, especially emerald fennell and barry keoghan.*at one point in the movie, felix (jacob elordi) says what everyone is thinking: ""i'm so effing hot."" if jacob elordi showed even the slightest interest in me, i too would be driven mad with love.final verdict: 10/10."

","""talented mr. ripley"" in reverse.i feel we are suppose to get a lesson here, but none is to be given. perhaps is to be aware of poor social climbers who exhibit intelligence. i know way too many people like that. which could be the message in itself. the idea of being popular runs a little too dark when a chance meeting between felix (a rich gatsby-esque character played by jacob elordi) and oliver (a socially awkward, possibly autistic, bright literary genius) at oxford.there are a few things that will rub you the wrong way. yes, it's suppose to be a dark comedy. i think rosamund pike, who plays felix's mother is the only one who understands that the key to dark comedy is to be a bit over the top. richard e. grant plays the dad who, unfortunately doesn't get the big eyed meltdown until the end. the other things you will either love or hate....
there is no reason for anyone to like oliver. ever. barry keoghan plays him great, but it isn't like he flips a switch and becomes charismatic. in fact, he just becomes a weirdo saying charismatic things. perhaps that's the intention. the family is so devoid of emotion that any genuine sign of it gains acceptance. again, i never felt that.there is absolutely no reason for oliver to know that felix would be so generous as to ingratiate him into his family by a flat tire ruse. the conceit of this entire film relies on the idea that oliver is a grifter preying on this family and that someone would be kind enough to take him in. he sees what he wants, then has the shameless nature of approaching each one to gain favor. honestly, one of the worse flip of the switch is when oliver observes the sister of the household and seduces her (after a few words--saying she's a nympho doesn't make it so).any way, rosamund pike is the only good thing about this flick. jacob elordi is also really good at embodying the rich snob with a heart. the rest is a bit mediocre. if you've seen these types of identity starved sociopath movies, you'll know what you're watching."

","emerald fennel's saltburn is a caustic, funny, disturbing contribution to the burgeoning sub-genre of 'eat the rich' films, which like to make you chuckle as much as they try to elicit gasps of shock. it's a sign of growing societal anger at the super-rich that such films are finding such willing audiences and creators, and anger is an emotion that shone through fennel's previous film, the similarly tonally mixed promising young woman.if that film announced the arrival of a significant directorial talent, saltburn cements her in the top division. brilliantly written, technically flawless, and acted to perfection by a superb cast, it's a film that's notable for so much. it's firmly written and shot with the female gaze even if the central characters are male, deft tracking shots punctuate the film as layers of plot and character are peeled back, there are subtly brilliant tricks of cinematography, production design, sound design, and lighting, and music (to name a few) that mean it will reward multiple re-watchings. it's also, surely, the final confirmation of barry keoghan's arrival as a major player; his towering central performance allowing us to ruminate on the film's concern with how we are forced to play out pre-determined scripts for our lives, and what happens when we try to deviate from those willingly or unwillingly. i've seen the film criticised for unoriginality, which is surely to miss the point; not only does it wear its influences and sources on its sleeve (naming some of them explicitly), but it's precisely this complex meta-textuality that allows the film to work on so many levels and not just as a one-note satire.it will inevitably alienate some for whom the material is too shocking or too graphic, which is understandable; if that's not you, it's an invitation to something as deliriously entertaining as it is disturbing."

","i have an interesting history and relationship with this film. never before has a film made me question the nature of reality before. at first glance, the matrix at the surface might have looked like a really good action movie with some cutting edge special effects with a kinetic and engaging story, and it definitely has that, but on my first viewing of this movie back in 2006 when i was 9 years old and slid this dvd into my small box tv at the end of my bed. i had absolutely no idea what i was in for and what i was about to experience.this movie is actually more disturbing and honestly terrifying than many would let on, especially to a young child when this movie drops some major psychological and philosophical themes in it's first act. the first 40 minutes of the matrix is frankly terrifying and suspenseful in all the best and right ways.the surreal bugging scene with that crazy bug with the long tendrils swirling around in what looks like a higher frame rate than the rest of the shot around it, followed by the mirror scream and the metallic drowning scream followed by the waking up in the pod of human entrails scene, followed by the highly messed up ""how do you define 'real'"" where the concept of reality literally goes up in quotation marks and flies away, where the movie sets the tone that 'reality is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain' is the most we humans can make of our surroundings - almost makes the concept of the matrix scarily plausible - and also in a way kind of timely of how the internet has evolved leaps and bounds since 1999 and the plausibility of vr at the moment (i mean have you seen half-life alyx)and of course you have the explanation of the matrix that follows. truly one of the heaviest exposition scenes in cinema history.and that's about as far as i survived my first viewing of this movie all those years ago. as a kid's first viewing, this movie successfully found it's way inside my head and left my mind shattered literally unable to watch any more. you would think that would be a terrible thing to say about a movie, but not here. the matrix is an unparalleled and unprecedented movie experience as humanity is at the core of this movie.the first act plays as a setup for such a hopeless notion as the nature of the matrix is revealed, only to have this notion flipped on it's head when the matrix itself starts being a fun place to be in the eyes of neo and the evolution of his character aswell as the rebels that he meets that teach him of the humanity that underlies every person trapped inside it under the oppression of the inhuman controllers.once the true nature of the matrix is revealed. you can bend it to your will and then you can do whatever you want. the matrix is the ultimate story and parable of humanity overcoming and opressive and dystopian scenario, being controlled by machines, and is masterful in it's writing and direction. the casting was very well thought out with keanu reeves killing it as neo, aswell as laurence fishburne and carrie anne-moss as great supporting roles, with hugo weaving as an extremley strong sci-fi villan as the cold, sociopathic ai villan agent smith.with neo as the embodiment of humanity against smith which is devoid of such, follows an unforgettable experience of human over machine. a classic and terrifyingly brilliant film which may cause you to have an internal existential crisis, but that's just the power of this film."

","** may contain spoilers **there aren't many movies i watched in the theatre twice ¬ñ let alone on the same day - but immediately after the credits had rolled (and still pumped up by 'rage against the machine'), i queued up for the next screening of 'the matrix'. i was so blown away by that film, i feared - and probably rightly so - that i hadn't caught every detail of what i'd just seen. i later found out that many of my friends had had a similar reaction to the film, and i know virtually no one who liked the film and didn't watch it at least twice. it's simply one of those rare films that are so rich you just have to watch them several times.in structure, style and concept, 'the matrix' was ground-breaking; it marked the first time the visual style of manga comic books and anime such as 'akira' or 'ghost in the shell' had been successfully translated to a live-action film. apart from 'blade runner', which has a totally different mood and pace (but is also a masterpiece and visionary film-making), there simply hadn't been anything even remotely like it. the jaw-dropping action sequences have such a raw, gripping energy they feel like an adrenalin overdose, but unlike most action films, they never overshadow the story; on the contrary - they enhance it and make complete sense within that universe.as for the story itself, i think this is one of the most original, fascinating sci-fi tales you'll likely ever see on screen. clearly inspired by japanese anime and manga yet also by authors like isaac asimov or philip k. dick, the story about humanity's war against its own creation, machines of an artificial intelligence that have evolved to the point where they have become the dominant 'species' and vastly superior to their creators, could take place in the same world as 'blade runner' or 'the terminator' - albeit several hundred years later. but there is also a mythical, even religious undercurrent to the story; the themes of a prophecy, a ""liberator"" or even a ""messiah"" make 'the matrix' transcend the science-fiction genre and become even more unique.'the matrix' was a watershed moment in filmmaking ¬ñ in every respect ¬ñ and even though two inferior sequels have left a bit of a stain on the film, they can't distract from what an uncompromising and hugely influential masterpiece this is. sci-fi movies that were released after 'the matrix' have tried very hard to achieve a similar look and tone, but the original still owns them all. 10 stars out of 10.favorite films: http://www.imdb.com/list/mkjokvqlsbs/lesser-known masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/favorite tv-shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"

","writing a review of the matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore i want to do the film justice by writing a good review. to tell the truth the first time i saw the film i was enamored by the effects. i remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films i had ever seen in my life. also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. it wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that i started to think about the film. i recognized the christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until i wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that i tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. i won't say that i have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.acting wise the film works excellently. i won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. keanu reeves plays the main character, neo, or thomas a. anderson and while he is not the perfect actor i think he does a pretty good job in the matrix (and the sequels). he doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and i must say that overall his body language is very good. very clear and well defined. laurence fishbourne plays neo's mentor morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. his lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. carrie-anne moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. joe pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, cypher, to life. i can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and i certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. gloria foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. the best acting is provided by hugo weaving, however, in his portrayal of agent smith. it is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. agent smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). two thumbs way up to weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the best film category) ahead of even star wars. the reason that i think the matrix deserves the oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in the matrix are more innovative than the ones in star wars. just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. the effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in blade runner and this works brilliantly. the film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my god has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. very well done.the reason that i think the matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing i catch something i didn't see the previous time i watched it. without spoiling the film i think i can mention a few of the more obvious elements. obviously the film draws on the messiah myth as neo is a clear reference to jesus with the analogy of his name (neo = one, as in the one) but also hidden in his other name, thomas a. anderson. the first part of his last name, anderson comes from the greek andros meaning ""man"" and combine this with the second part of his last name ""son"" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination ""son of man"" which was a title jesus came up with about himself. also the first time we meet neo a man calls him (and i quote): ""you're my saviour man. my own personal jesus christ."" it doesn't get any more obvious than that. aside from the christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from budhism, gnosticism (gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by plato and his analogy of the cave and jean baudrillard's essay, simulacra and simulations. explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them i will not comment on them further.to all the people who doubt the profound nature of the matrix i can only give one advice: free your mind and watch the film again. you won't regret it. if i had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either the matrix (obviously i don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or the lord of the rings: the return of the king and i recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.10/10 - on my top 3 of best films."

","my review of the best epic science fiction action film, the matrix (1999) starring keanu reeves, laurence fishburne, carrie-anne moss, hugo weaving, joe pantoliano, marcus chong and gloria foster.this was be the first movie i went to see in the movie theater with my mom when i was 15.years old, when i read in the magazines about the matrix i was blown away and i wanted to see it right away. the matrix is the best action sci-fi films that keanu reeves made in the 90's. it is one of my personal favorite movies. the matrix is a (1999) american science fiction action film written and directed by the wachowskis, starring keanu reeves, laurence fishburne, carrie-anne moss, hugo weaving, and joe pantoliano. it depicts a dystopia future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called ""the matrix"", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. computer programmer ""neo"" learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the ""dream world"".written and directed by the wachowski brothers, this classic sci-fi action film stars keanu reeves as a lowly computer programmer who discovers his entire existence, and that of all mankind, is nothing but a simulation in a computer. the reality within a reality is a concept that's done before... but never like this - the matrix requires absolute attention from his audience, least you'll be completely lost in a few minutes. with the help of supporting cast members laurence fishburne and carrie-anne-moss, reeves discovers that inside this simulation environment known as the matrix, he can control, bend, and manipulate space-time... resulting in some of the most incredibly iconic images to ever grace the silver screen. the slow-motion ""bullet-time"" effects as they're known today were groundbreaking and revolutionary when we first saw them 12 years ago. although reeves is notorious for his inability to really convey much emotional range, his character here lends itself well to him as an actor. this is a movie that makes you think, makes you gasp, and makes totally forget where the 136-minutes went after finishing it. it's no wonder this film spawned two very successful sequels, and dozens of copy-cats. the matrix, ""visually revolutionary, and mind-blowing."" keanu reeves plays the main character, neo, or thomas a. anderson and while he is not the perfect actor i think he does a pretty good job in the matrix. he doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and i must say that overall his body language is very good. very clear and well defined. laurence fishbourne plays neo's mentor morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. his lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. carrie-anne moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. joe pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, cypher, to life. he also played the roles in underrated daredevil (2003)and bad boys i & ii. i can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot. gloria foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. the best acting is provided by hugo weaving, however, in his portrayal of agent smith. it is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. agent smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor. two thumbs way up to weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the best film category) ahead of even star wars. the reason that i think the matrix deserves the oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in the matrix are more innovative than the ones in star wars. just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. the effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopia atmosphere not unlike the one seen in blade runner and this works brilliantly. the film looks beautiful at all times and today 16 years later (my god has it already been 16 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. very well done.the film also won 4 academy awards including for best visual effects. 
10/10 for one of the best epic american science fiction action film's in the history movies like this and aliens (1986) don't exist anymore. it is one of my personal favorite movies, it is the movie i saw with my mom in the movie theater it is memories on my mom who is no longer with us anymore and i miss he."

","'the matrix' may not be one of the very greatest examples of its genre (like '2001', 'metropolis', 'blade runner', 'back to the future', 'star wars original trilogy', 'alien' and 'aliens'), but that it is revolutionary in how its visuals and use of sound broke boundaries like had never been done before cannot be denied.it is not a film to be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth, with the forced and underdeveloped love subplot between neo and trinity being 'the matrix's' sole weak spot. this ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.particularly striking about 'the matrix' is its production values. simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. so much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. andy and larry wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even lewis carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, kung fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.keanu reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. carrie anne moss is strong. even better are an imposingly charismatic laurence fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing joe pantoliano and a deliciously wicked hugo weaving.summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. followed by two sequels, both nowhere near in the same ball-park. 9/10 bethany cox"

","at first, i wasn't interested in seeing the matrix. but after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, i hear bad reviews for every movie i enjoy) i decided to give it a try. at first, although i really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) by the second time i watched it, i really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.i really loved this movie. just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. the acting was excellent. even though i think this was keanu reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by laurence fishburne (morpheus) and carrie-anne moss (trinity). hugo weaving did an excellent job as agent smith and joe pantoliano was great as cypher as well.the plot is one of the best movie plots i've seen in a movie. an accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. the greatest thing is that you learn things just as neo does, so you can really relate to his character.my favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. i guarantee this. some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but i recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away."

"2415","the matrix","david-meldrum",2019-02-22,9," 20 years on from release, some random thoughts on revisiting the matrix. spoiler: it's still brilliant.
","20 years after its release, and several years since i last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching the matrix. in no particular order ...1) it still look great. i mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. but otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. it's sumptuous.2) i think i was one of the many who misjudged keanu reeves all those yeas ago. i made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. from this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. it's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.3) it's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. i knew this 20 years ago, but since then i've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around i especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. i noticed a lot of peckinpah, and did i see a nod to kurosawa there too? and i was reminded that for an english literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.4) seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. there's a lot we could talk about here, but i was especially struck by how indebted a director like christopher nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with inception.5) i'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about neo's identity until just before the end. i'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.6) despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. the film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. it's a lean film, without a wasted moment.7) the film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. when i wrote a chapter on this for my ba theology dissertation, i said i thought the film was neo-bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and i stand by that on rewatching. of course, there's lots of allusions to christian and other theology, and the matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by christians which has never really stopped. when will some christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? it's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.8) all these years later, it turns out the matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. humans permanently plugged in to networks? different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? the wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.9) bottom line. i still bloody love this film. i'm trying to work out if i have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels...."
"2416","the matrix","tayloryee94",2020-10-01,10," still hip as heck even after 20 years
","you name it. technology, cgi, flow of the story, the concept, action, romance, style, music,... everything you want is realized in this movie to the level of perfection. the scene where neo and trinity go to the virtual reality to save morpheus is so fashionable that i screamed. the camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. the entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.i can see how much research wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. how is dystopian future and present is connected? how does dream within a dream work? all the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. there is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.their concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. in 2020, we see ai taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.the impact of 'the matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated cgi techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of neo. because the matrix system in the movie is kindly well-explained, it widens a scale of sci-fi genre. hunger games, inception, eagle eye, wall-e, and so many other movies that followed benefited from this epic work."

","the first 45 minutes of this film had me very excited. it is so rare that i will go to the theater and be presented with something which is both original and intelligent. it managed to hang in there throughout, though the ending was too formulaic. in addition, the voice-over at the very end reminded me of the final scene in saving private ryan. it almost ruins a fantastic film.the only other objection i can come up with is that the you must know, you must be type philosophy being handed out was just a tad hokey. i must pleasantly admit though, since i don't get to admit this very often, that the matrix is worth seeing despite these things.the visuals are extremely impressive, particularly the ""white room,"" the baby harvester, the training scene with the ""red woman,"" the reeves interrogation scene... i have to agree with some of the previous comments that the plot idea won't seem overly original to a fan of philip k dick, but then what is original after you've read him? the matrix has more original things to say than two months worth of standard hollywood fare. i have a great deal of respect for a film which will have someone say ""they're turning humans into this"" and hold up a battery. a plot which looks at man as machine will get a thumbs up from me just for trying.i feel some hope for the future of movie-making in america to be able to recommend this film."

","without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since stanley kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey and ridley scott's blade runner. the matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.the film tells the story of thomas anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of neo. when he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by a.i powered machines.the direction and script by the wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. the research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.the cinematography is impeccable. it was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the matrix and the real world. the editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. the visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. the performances are also incredible. each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is hugo weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, agent smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.in conclusion the matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. it is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made."

"2424","the matrix","mambubukid",2000-09-19,NA," the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come
","the story of a reluctant christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, mtv backdrop, the matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre.  there have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (or nobody simply cared about anything.)  there a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects.  with the matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync.  not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition.  not only did we sit in awe as neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.but what makes the matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes.  the script, written by the wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky.  the kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even bruce lee would've been proud of.  the photography was breathtaking.  (i bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.)  and the acting?  maybe not the best keanu reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, neo, to a t the way reeves did.  but, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside laurence fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting.  as morpheus, mr. fishburne is simply wicked!  shades of his mentor-role in higher learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than mr. fishburne.  his character, battle-scarred but always composed morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (he loves neo to a fault.) only mr. fishburne can flesh out.people will say what they want to say about how good the matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation.  my generation. the wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little p.s. note when they finished the script saying: think for a moment about your existence.  what is the matrix, you ask?  something that's closer to reality than you think.either that or it's my personal choice for best film of all-time."

","in an age when movie and tv franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (i'm looking at you, disney), i don't think anyone was expecting much from puss in boots: the last wish - certainly not i.after the first 5 minutes, i knew this was something special.firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from arkane and enter the spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. the 2d elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.the music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).the dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling i think i've ever seen. in a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. the cast do a great job of selling them too. goldi and the bears come out with brilliant british-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.and then there's the wolf. this character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. his style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, i'm serious).at a time when disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - dreamworks have taken on the mantle.it made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. you might think i'm overselling it, but hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.there are those that say that hollywood is done - i know i do. but dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

-very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.adorable characters/feel
-new characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-the feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-has that element of shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.the animation
-it's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy dreamworks does so well.-the design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-the world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that i certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-and it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than disney for the blend of real and cartoons.the voice acting:
-many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that snl like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. he own the horner character and brought some of the best lines.-wagner moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the big-bad wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-pugh is okay, not my favorite role as goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. it does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-banderas takes boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the spanish stereotype. and yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.the references/jokes
-the stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of shrek.-it's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-the fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-it feels like the first two shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. again, refreshing that they were able to step back.the designs changes to an extent
-creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-like into the spiderverse? good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that puss does.-not overused, which is very good for me.the action at times
-shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-this movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-the ending fight shows the potential of what dreamworks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes i've seen this year.the heart
-lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-the movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-there are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. that's hard to do in many things.-i love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-have not felt this way since shrek 2.dislikes:the darkness
-it's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.predictable
-the lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-the movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.too many antagonists
-one of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-they do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.the comedy is still tapered
-it's starting to go back to shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made shrek, shrek.-they took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.the animation changes at times
-the animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-the comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.the action still not complete
--shrek and shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-this movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-the stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-they sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-often was shorter than i wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.the verdict
i must say, puss in boots: the last wish was a much better film than when i walked in. perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. it evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. and it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. this film is indeed a solid return to the world and i had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. however, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance i was looking for. the movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with puss in boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. and the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the shrek that we saw in the first two movies. still, i do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

","this is the best animated feature since into the spider-verse, and probably better than toy story 4 and soul. i don't find many movies rewatchable nowadays and this is one of the few. not only is it a visual masterpiece (huge credit to the animators, well done!) but from a critical standpoint is has extremely well done characters, an engaging and relatable story, and takes very bold actions that will leave animation-lovers stunned for years to come. spoilers would be ruining an experience that you simply must witness for yourself, so what are you waiting for? believe the hype, go watch it if you haven't already! 9.5/10 but imma round up.edit: i've given it a year and came back to it and it's just even better the second viewing. in my opinion this is dreamwork's greatest movie (especially if you take away the first 5 minutes), better than kung fu panda, how to train your dragon, even prince of egypt. also the only dreamworks movie that i think deserves a 10/10. it's one thing to make an actually good and compelling story but to be also very entertaining and engaging for everyone is another feat. the user ratings and critics ratings are way too low. most criticisms of the movie are, imo, flawed, non-existent or biased. i sincerely cannot recommend this movie enough."

'the last wish' may not be among the best films i have ever seen, but it is an interesting and enjoyable watch for sure.the visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the blend of two distinct animation art styles makes for an interesting cinematic experience, the score, too, sprinkled its fair share of magic, and on top of that, the characters are more fleshed out, unlike the last time, and the inclusion of 'perrito' and 'death' brought radical changes to the narrative, their mere presence made this more exciting."

","after losing his eighth life to a bell falling on top of him, puss in boots is down to his last life. an encounter from a vicious bounty hunter with a frightening presence destroys his confidence and for the first time, he feels fear. after escaping by the skin of his teeth, he decides he is no longer worthy of the name puss in boots and begins life as an adopted cat. he learns about the dark forest where someone can make a wish on the wishing star. with this in mind, the crafty feline returns to adventure to get his lives back.a little late to review this movie, but i still caught it in theaters. i knew from the trailer that this would be a cool movie. at first, i was wondering why dreamworks is creating another puss in boots movie. it feels weird to make a sequel to a spin-off that came out over a decade ago. as someone who has not watched the original puss in boots, i do not think you need to watch the original to get what is going on here aside from maybe puss' relationship with kitty softpaws. with that said, let me tell you how good this movie is!puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animated films. first of all, the animation looks absolutely stunning. the movie has probably the best animation from a cgi film i have ever seen. not only do the movement and expressions look smooth and crisp, the cinematography and imagery looks amazing and memorable too. there are many awesome shots in this film such as a shot of puss staring in the eyes of death. these shots strengthen the emotional moments and even some of the funny moments as well. every shot in this movie looks awesome. the animation really shows its fluidity in the action scenes. this movie has better action than 90% percent of the live-action blockbusters out there. the set pieces are so dynamic and entertaining that there is not a boring moment in the film. the opening set piece sets the tone for the entire movie and from that point forward, i knew i was in for a ride. the soundtrack is awesome too from the catchy score to the fun opening song for puss in boots.fantastic visuals aside, the story is memorable too. this movie pushes its pg rating. there is blood, cursing and dark themes that may frighten younger viewers. the story is about how puss is reacting to the idea that he is on deaths door. if he dies one more time, he will be gone forever. this is a movie where we see one of the coolest and most confident characters in animation lose his confidence. with that, he has a character arc that gives him depths and flaws that are relatable so even when he does something kind of selfish, you can still sympathize with his motivations. this movie has a lot of stylish action and funny jokes, but the scenes revolving around the wolf ramp up the dark tone of the movie. it never loses its sense of humor and this is one funny movie. i love the snarky dialogue, perrito gets one scene with goldilocks and the three bears that steals the show comedy wise. this movie has the perfect mix of comedy, action, drama and emotional moments to make it stand out.in addition to a great story, the cast of characters are memorable too. puss is at his best. he is the same awesome and adorable character from shrek, but he is given a lot of vulnerability here. he starts out as this arrogant, but powerful guy who can take down giants, but when he sees that death is coming for him, you can see how it shakes him to the core. his friends kitty softpaws and especially perrito are great characters too. perrito seems like the guy that would annoy everyone, but he is a great support character who is hilarious and just plain adorable. he is also surprisingly aware of emotions. there is one scene with him and puss that warmed my heart.as for the antagonists, the wolf is one of my favorite antagonists in an animated film. he has a badass voice, he completely changes the tone of the movie and he wipes out puss' bravado entirely and reduces him to a frightened cat. he is also a great fighter, but it is his presence, voice, dialogue and whistle that make him truly memorable. kids might have nightmares because of him. goldilocks and the three bears are fun anti-villains that have a sweet bond with each other. then there is the gluttonous scumbag jack horner. this is the character the writers decided to just make as hilariously hatable and disgusting as possible. they make no attempt to give this guy any sympathetic trait and i love it. we need more outright terrible people in new animated films. he is a funny villain with how unapologetic he is towards his minions, but you will be actively rooting for this character's demise.every single character in this film is memorable to a degree. it helps that the voice acting in this movie is excellent with antonio banderas as puss, salma hayek as kitty, harvey gull√©n as perrito, john mulaney as jack horner and especially wagner moura as the wolf. moura might have one of the best voices for a villain in animation i have seen in a while. each person brings their character to life in this movie. i can see any main character here being someone's favorite in the movie. that is how you know that you have a great cast.there is not a dull moment in this movie. puss in boots: the last wish is everything i love about animation and more. i did not expect a movie like this to be that great, but when i saw the trailers with the gorgeous animation, i knew this movie was going to be a ride. i did not expect it to become one of my favorite films of 2022, but it definitely. i really hope it wins best animated feature at the academy awards this year. dreamworks deserves this one. check it out as soon as you can."

","don't get me wrong, i liked the first movie a lot but i had issues with it. humpty dumpty is one of the most confusing and dumb villains ever in dreamworks history, and kitty didn't felt like her own character and she was rendered a bit pathetically. however fortunately the last wish doesn't have those problems. kitty actually felt like her own character with her own choices and the villain is a huge improvement over humpty dumpty. instead of the confusing story we got, death was excellent. he was absolutely terrifying and a fitting antagonist for puss for about death. but the overall villain was jack horner and just like any other good villains, he was actively threatening, and a good story to back it up. the first had great action but this had a great great action if you know what i mean. only the kung fu panda and spider verse movies beat this in action. i particularly liked the climactic final duel between puss and death, it's such a creative battle and colorful as well. speaking of colorful, it was a wise move to adopt to the comic style animation instead of rest of the shrek franchise with realistic 3d animation. and one more praise are the messages, the first barely had a message to begin with because the message was bogged down by the confusing plot involving humpty. however the message was well and clearly told during this film because of family trope. goldie ended up appreciating her current family and puss himself ended up appreciating his friends and kitty instead of glory and fame which is a pretty strong message.however i just have one complaint. wasn't kitty and puss madly in love at the end of the first movie? i felt like they did it all over again and puss's arch in the first 30mins was a bit confusing which holds it back from becoming my 2nd favorite dreamworks film and a 10/10

"2495","the matrix","oktay_tuna",2023-01-12,9," a strange comparison(with breaking bad) and then some
","in the shrek movies, puss in boots was a very likable character. i think it is safe to assume that most of the people who love shrek (specifically shrek 2) also enjoy seeing puss in boots. it is enjoyable to watch him, doesn't interfere much with the themes of movies but has funny scenes and great action. as i was thinking of these things, i realized something. he is just like saul goodman from breaking bad. saul goodman is a great character in breaking bad. he is great in scenes he is in and is so fun to watch but he isn't much of a character. then better call saul came and saul goodman (jimmy mcgill) became as complex as (if not more) walter. first puss in boots movie wasn't like that for puss. it was more of the same in shrek movies. this movie delivers the character puss in boots desperately needed and then some. his arc in this movie is amazing and in a perfect world, the script of this movie would get an adapted screenplay nomination at the oscars this year (considering the fact that the competition in the adapted screenplay category is nonexistent).death is an amazing villain. having shorter screen time than most characters makes him an even better character. again another comparison to better call saul, death is like lalo salamanca. lalo also doesn't have a big screen time in the six seasons of the show, but he is easily one of the most memorable characters. death is always there, back in the audience's mind, and just when you forget that he exists, he returns. his whistle, his charisma... brilliant!puss and kitty's storyline and conflict are very complex when you remember that this is an animated movie mostly targeted at kids. the themes of legacy, the meaning of life, and the fear of attachment are very refreshing to see in an animated movie again. the addition of perrito creates a great contrast between him and puss and i would even go further to say that it can even spark some philosophical discussions about which way to live is better for you. legacy or living a life where you are comfortable with your family.i loved the additions of the three bears and goldilocks. their storyline was also fairly interesting to see progress but its pacing could have been better, which makes them the weakest links of the film which is a d**n good weak link if you ask me. the character of jack horner. he has very funny moments and is very interesting to see a villain who is truly deeply villainous with no point of return in an animated movie. the conscience bug thing was also interesting to see unfold.the animation and action scenes are superb. especially the ones with death. death is so good that i can't believe it. there are many jokes that land, songs that are fun and most importantly the movie structurally works. it just works. with this many characters, with this many plotlines, with this many detours, you might think that it is impossible to tie this in a great package. but they do. when this movie is at its worst, it is decent but when it is at its best it is one of the best-animated movies, ever.where did this movie come from? i would have wanted to be a kid when i first watched this movie. i would have been scared but i would have loved it. then i would have watched it again, sometime. and then again. it would have created nostalgia and at my age today when i would have looked back i would have said, ""it is not the best-animated movie ever, but it is my favorite animated movie ever."" because it would have been. what more can i say?"

","""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a fun adventure in the ""shrek"" universe! i gotta admit i have not seen the original film, and don't cherish the ""shrek"" films as much as many do... so i went into this with mild expectations. and honestly, i had a good time; it was cute! do i think it was as good as many other reviewers have suggested? no. but it was enjoyable, lighthearted fun that is perfect for families with kids! the voice cast was awesome, especially john mulaney and florence pugh as the villains, jack horner and goldilocks respectively. and of course antonio banderas as puss in boots is iconic as ever!the animation here was gorgeous too, honestly it was one of my favourite parts. i love that major studio animated movies are finally starting to take more risks with their animation style, moving away from the typical 3d cgi realism. you gotta respect ""spider-man: into the spider-verse"" for starting this trend and showing that different styles can work! i loved that this had a more watercolor, storybook illustration look to it, it really worked for the story and was employed in such creative ways! i would love to see the ""shrek"" movies take this on, but alas they seem to have established their own look. this movie just looked so cool, so distinct in its own style, it really felt like i was watching a story in a fairy tale world.now, of course i have to admit i didn't love this movie. something about it felt off to me, i couldn't seem to see where the acclaim was coming from. sure, it was fun, it was cute, and i enjoyed myself while watching, but i never felt like i truly connected with the film. the opening scene felt a little jumbled to me, rapidly going from a musical sequence, to comedy for kids, to an action scene and i wished it would've let me settle into the story a bit first. i get this is a movie primarily for kids, but with most animation they tend to make parts enjoyable for the parents and older audiences as well. i don't really feel that here - they tried with the themes and the deeper storyline - but it never actually worked in my eyes. everything felt very kid-focused, which isn't a bad thing, it just meant i wasn't the core audience and so it makes sense why i wouldn't enjoy it as much. i have to say, the kids in my theatre seemed to be having a blast! i'm sure this is a great movie for families with children, it just wasn't as good as i was told it would be.i think the movie tried to do a bit of what pixar is known for, the whole ""trying to be deep"" thing. the movie involves puss in boots coming to terms with death, and it seemed to be somewhat shallow, it never truly dove into this aspect of the story. instead, the storyline is very linear and somewhat dull where it is just about the characters traveling to their destination and the villains sometimes catching up and then combat ensuing. and the physical goal literally being the spiritual goal just makes the inevitable plot point of ""maybe i don't need the thing i wanted all long and it's the friends i made along the way that count"" seem all the more predictable. even puss' relationship with the side characters is unchallenging. although he is deeply flawed, his companions never seem to care about that and forgive him all the time. the chemistry of the characters was just nowhere as endearing as in ""shrek"". still the adventure was quite fun, i just didn't think the themes clicked as it felt like they were trying to be deep in a way that is not as organic and surprising as a film like pixar's ""up"", ""finding nemo"" or even dreamworks' ""how to train your dragon"".perhaps i am being too harsh, i feel like this review is sounding more negative than anything. i really did have fun with it, and overall would give it a thumbs up, it's an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half. the animation was really cool, the voice cast was great, and man i loved the little nods to the ""shrek"" movies even if i was never a huge fan of those. if nothing else, this movie did make me really hopeful for another ""shrek"" film. i do enjoy this fairy tale world and the creative animation they used to tell the story!"

","movies like this are the perfect counter to those who hold kid's movies to low standards. while this movie does have style, it's not particularly unique in terms of its story. it's a rather standard journey with most of what you'd expect from an animated kids movie. comedy relief sidekick, expected love interest, an irredeemable villain, etc etc... however, it does all of these so well that the predictability didn't matter. i know puss won't die, but the scenes with death are still tense because i buy puss' fear. after a while i knew goldie's wish would be for a human family and that by the end she'd learn to appreciate her bear family, but that doesn't change that it's very well done. big jack horner is cartoonishly evil, but he's the funniest character, and there are other characters who are actually well-developed so it didn't really matter. it has good action, a great opener, and some cool editing choices. aside from the great visual style and the fact that it expertly juggles three villain factions, this movie is pretty basic, but still great.it's not perfect though. in particular, i think the section at mama luna's was pretty meh. honestly, i don't think i'd care if the movie wasn't so tight, but the character mama luna herself wasn't really relevant and considering the prevalence of these scenes in the trailer, i think this could've been studio interference. maybe not though, one shouldn't assume that anything bad in a movie is due to execs.regardless, this is a great movie, easily top 5 in dreamwork's catalog, and probably higher. it's either an 8/10 or 9/10, can't really decide."

","when i first heard about the last wish, and saw some of the trailers, i thought it was going to be a bit goofy and not as good as the first one (though seeing puss say ""no hablo ingl√©s"" to get out of talking to that dog made me chuckle) and the stylized animation looked cheap and kind of hurt my eyes and i wasn't that interested. however, once i saw a few clips of it, i thought it looked rather interesting and decided to give a shot.after i finally watched it, i have to admit it was actually very good and comparable to the first puss in boots movie and in some cases, even better. the premise was interesting, the animation actually was pretty good, the stylized animation actually worked out pretty well (especially for the action sequences), full of new characters that were funny and cool, and had some important life lessons for everyone to remember and use in their everyday lives.so i liked the premise because puss using up eight of his nine lives and trying to get to the last wish to gain them back while also battling a bunch of other characters who want the wish sets up a cool and interesting story that'll keep you hooked to see who actually gets the wish. you can kind of guess what will happen in the end, but you still want to see what happens regardless.the animation was pretty beautiful as well because although they did not use the realistic animation of the shrek movies or the first puss in boots movie, having it stylized and more comic book-like works out well here as it makes the movie look more vivid and gives you a more fairy tale vibe. plus, there were more details they could add to the characters and the scenery as well. also, as much it kind of looked cheap, the stylized animation worked out well for some of the action scenes and made them look pretty cool and graphic and added more suspense to the fight scenes between the good guys and the bad guys.the characters were also pretty cool as well. puss (once again voiced by antonio banderas) is just as funny, cool, and energetic as he always was in the previous films, kitty softpaws (once again voiced by selma hayek) adds some great humor and banter with puss once again in his mission, and the new characters were quite interesting too. perrito, the little dog (voiced by harvey guill√©n), is pretty funny and although plays the typical annoying sidekick, his role works out pretty well here as he helps puss and kitty. goldilocks and the three bears (voiced by florence pugh, olivia colman, ray winstone, and samson kayo) add some funny humor as well and their banter with each other is quite hilarious as well. big jack horner, one of the villains (voiced by john mulaney), is certainly devious and sarcastic, and his dark humor is ironically quite funny at times (i mean, if he's voiced by mulaney, then obviously it's going to be funny, due to his rather deadpan delivery of his lines).then there's the wolf (voiced by wagner moura), who serves as the other villain in this, but way darker and more sinister than jack horner. specifically, he is really the grim reaper who is after puss for him cheating death eight times and wants to take his last life as punishment, even though puss is still alive. now, when i say this character is dark, he--is--dark! like from his red eyes to his hooded figure to his low, slow, creepy sounding voice to his spine chilling/goosebump inducing whistling to his only intention of claiming puss' last life, this is a dark villain done right and probably one of the best ones in any dreamworks movie in a long time. heck, i was surprised the directors and writers made the wolf as dark as they did as it would certainly freak out some kids, and even some adults as well. at the same time though, i'll give them credit for really stepping it up here and making a very interesting and intimidating villain, as well as not making him a surprise villain too and you knew he was a villain from the beginning (the surprise villain trope has been used too much lately and it was nice to have the obvious villain trope come back once again in my opinion). i would say if you have kids, viewer discretion is advised for the wolf's scenes, but it's just a few scenes and it's not constantly.now for the themes, they were definitely important ones that i believe we all should consider in our daily lives. i won't try to spoil anything with them, but the themes presented in the last wish involve being happy with the family you grew up with even if they're not your biological family, being around people (and animals) that you can trust, and also, accepting that death is an inevitable thing, but that means living life to the fullest and enjoying every moment of it and do not waste it. again, not trying to spoil too much, but they were presented really well in the last wish that will definitely grasp your attention and might even get you thinking about how things are going with your life and might make you consider making some better changes for yourself.alright, so i know that was a lot to say here, but i just wanted to go over everything that i liked about the last wish. i know it's been out for a while now, but for those who haven't seen it yet, i'd recommend giving it a chance because it's definitely one of the better animated movies that have come out in recent years and it's one that i'm sure you'll love instantly once you watch it. it does have its serious moments, but it has a good blend of that and humor and some touching moments that hit you in the feels. lastly, if you're a fan of puss in boots, then seeing him in action once again will definitely satisfy your movie going needs.so if you have netflix, apple tv, or any other streaming service puss in boots: the last wish is on, go watch it!!!"

","don't get me wrong, i liked the first movie a lot but i had issues with it. humpty dumpty is one of the most confusing and dumb villains ever in dreamworks history, and kitty didn't felt like her own character and she was rendered a bit pathetically. however fortunately the last wish doesn't have those problems. kitty actually felt like her own character with her own choices and the villain is a huge improvement over humpty dumpty. instead of the confusing story we got, death was excellent. he was absolutely terrifying and a fitting antagonist for puss for about death. but the overall villain was jack horner and just like any other good villains, he was actively threatening, and a good story to back it up. the first had great action but this had a great great action if you know what i mean. only the kung fu panda and spider verse movies beat this in action. i particularly liked the climactic final duel between puss and death, it's such a creative battle and colorful as well. speaking of colorful, it was a wise move to adopt to the comic style animation instead of rest of the shrek franchise with realistic 3d animation. and one more praise are the messages, the first barely had a message to begin with because the message was bogged down by the confusing plot involving humpty. however the message was well and clearly told during this film because of family trope. goldie ended up appreciating her current family and puss himself ended up appreciating his friends and kitty instead of glory and fame which is a pretty strong message.however i just have one complaint. wasn't kitty and puss madly in love at the end of the first movie? i felt like they did it all over again and puss's arch in the first 30mins was a bit confusing which holds it back from becoming my 2nd favorite dreamworks film and a 10/10

"2512","the matrix","oktay_tuna",2023-01-12,9," a strange comparison(with breaking bad) and then some
","in the shrek movies, puss in boots was a very likable character. i think it is safe to assume that most of the people who love shrek (specifically shrek 2) also enjoy seeing puss in boots. it is enjoyable to watch him, doesn't interfere much with the themes of movies but has funny scenes and great action. as i was thinking of these things, i realized something. he is just like saul goodman from breaking bad. saul goodman is a great character in breaking bad. he is great in scenes he is in and is so fun to watch but he isn't much of a character. then better call saul came and saul goodman (jimmy mcgill) became as complex as (if not more) walter. first puss in boots movie wasn't like that for puss. it was more of the same in shrek movies. this movie delivers the character puss in boots desperately needed and then some. his arc in this movie is amazing and in a perfect world, the script of this movie would get an adapted screenplay nomination at the oscars this year (considering the fact that the competition in the adapted screenplay category is nonexistent).death is an amazing villain. having shorter screen time than most characters makes him an even better character. again another comparison to better call saul, death is like lalo salamanca. lalo also doesn't have a big screen time in the six seasons of the show, but he is easily one of the most memorable characters. death is always there, back in the audience's mind, and just when you forget that he exists, he returns. his whistle, his charisma... brilliant!puss and kitty's storyline and conflict are very complex when you remember that this is an animated movie mostly targeted at kids. the themes of legacy, the meaning of life, and the fear of attachment are very refreshing to see in an animated movie again. the addition of perrito creates a great contrast between him and puss and i would even go further to say that it can even spark some philosophical discussions about which way to live is better for you. legacy or living a life where you are comfortable with your family.i loved the additions of the three bears and goldilocks. their storyline was also fairly interesting to see progress but its pacing could have been better, which makes them the weakest links of the film which is a d**n good weak link if you ask me. the character of jack horner. he has very funny moments and is very interesting to see a villain who is truly deeply villainous with no point of return in an animated movie. the conscience bug thing was also interesting to see unfold.the animation and action scenes are superb. especially the ones with death. death is so good that i can't believe it. there are many jokes that land, songs that are fun and most importantly the movie structurally works. it just works. with this many characters, with this many plotlines, with this many detours, you might think that it is impossible to tie this in a great package. but they do. when this movie is at its worst, it is decent but when it is at its best it is one of the best-animated movies, ever.where did this movie come from? i would have wanted to be a kid when i first watched this movie. i would have been scared but i would have loved it. then i would have watched it again, sometime. and then again. it would have created nostalgia and at my age today when i would have looked back i would have said, ""it is not the best-animated movie ever, but it is my favorite animated movie ever."" because it would have been. what more can i say?"

","""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a fun adventure in the ""shrek"" universe! i gotta admit i have not seen the original film, and don't cherish the ""shrek"" films as much as many do... so i went into this with mild expectations. and honestly, i had a good time; it was cute! do i think it was as good as many other reviewers have suggested? no. but it was enjoyable, lighthearted fun that is perfect for families with kids! the voice cast was awesome, especially john mulaney and florence pugh as the villains, jack horner and goldilocks respectively. and of course antonio banderas as puss in boots is iconic as ever!the animation here was gorgeous too, honestly it was one of my favourite parts. i love that major studio animated movies are finally starting to take more risks with their animation style, moving away from the typical 3d cgi realism. you gotta respect ""spider-man: into the spider-verse"" for starting this trend and showing that different styles can work! i loved that this had a more watercolor, storybook illustration look to it, it really worked for the story and was employed in such creative ways! i would love to see the ""shrek"" movies take this on, but alas they seem to have established their own look. this movie just looked so cool, so distinct in its own style, it really felt like i was watching a story in a fairy tale world.now, of course i have to admit i didn't love this movie. something about it felt off to me, i couldn't seem to see where the acclaim was coming from. sure, it was fun, it was cute, and i enjoyed myself while watching, but i never felt like i truly connected with the film. the opening scene felt a little jumbled to me, rapidly going from a musical sequence, to comedy for kids, to an action scene and i wished it would've let me settle into the story a bit first. i get this is a movie primarily for kids, but with most animation they tend to make parts enjoyable for the parents and older audiences as well. i don't really feel that here - they tried with the themes and the deeper storyline - but it never actually worked in my eyes. everything felt very kid-focused, which isn't a bad thing, it just meant i wasn't the core audience and so it makes sense why i wouldn't enjoy it as much. i have to say, the kids in my theatre seemed to be having a blast! i'm sure this is a great movie for families with children, it just wasn't as good as i was told it would be.i think the movie tried to do a bit of what pixar is known for, the whole ""trying to be deep"" thing. the movie involves puss in boots coming to terms with death, and it seemed to be somewhat shallow, it never truly dove into this aspect of the story. instead, the storyline is very linear and somewhat dull where it is just about the characters traveling to their destination and the villains sometimes catching up and then combat ensuing. and the physical goal literally being the spiritual goal just makes the inevitable plot point of ""maybe i don't need the thing i wanted all long and it's the friends i made along the way that count"" seem all the more predictable. even puss' relationship with the side characters is unchallenging. although he is deeply flawed, his companions never seem to care about that and forgive him all the time. the chemistry of the characters was just nowhere as endearing as in ""shrek"". still the adventure was quite fun, i just didn't think the themes clicked as it felt like they were trying to be deep in a way that is not as organic and surprising as a film like pixar's ""up"", ""finding nemo"" or even dreamworks' ""how to train your dragon"".perhaps i am being too harsh, i feel like this review is sounding more negative than anything. i really did have fun with it, and overall would give it a thumbs up, it's an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half. the animation was really cool, the voice cast was great, and man i loved the little nods to the ""shrek"" movies even if i was never a huge fan of those. if nothing else, this movie did make me really hopeful for another ""shrek"" film. i do enjoy this fairy tale world and the creative animation they used to tell the story!"

","movies like this are the perfect counter to those who hold kid's movies to low standards. while this movie does have style, it's not particularly unique in terms of its story. it's a rather standard journey with most of what you'd expect from an animated kids movie. comedy relief sidekick, expected love interest, an irredeemable villain, etc etc... however, it does all of these so well that the predictability didn't matter. i know puss won't die, but the scenes with death are still tense because i buy puss' fear. after a while i knew goldie's wish would be for a human family and that by the end she'd learn to appreciate her bear family, but that doesn't change that it's very well done. big jack horner is cartoonishly evil, but he's the funniest character, and there are other characters who are actually well-developed so it didn't really matter. it has good action, a great opener, and some cool editing choices. aside from the great visual style and the fact that it expertly juggles three villain factions, this movie is pretty basic, but still great.it's not perfect though. in particular, i think the section at mama luna's was pretty meh. honestly, i don't think i'd care if the movie wasn't so tight, but the character mama luna herself wasn't really relevant and considering the prevalence of these scenes in the trailer, i think this could've been studio interference. maybe not though, one shouldn't assume that anything bad in a movie is due to execs.regardless, this is a great movie, easily top 5 in dreamwork's catalog, and probably higher. it's either an 8/10 or 9/10, can't really decide."
"2517","the matrix","jph-65157",2023-08-02,9," beautifully animated, cool action sequences, funny new/returning characters, and full of important life lessons.
","when i first heard about the last wish, and saw some of the trailers, i thought it was going to be a bit goofy and not as good as the first one (though seeing puss say ""no hablo ingl√©s"" to get out of talking to that dog made me chuckle) and the stylized animation looked cheap and kind of hurt my eyes and i wasn't that interested. however, once i saw a few clips of it, i thought it looked rather interesting and decided to give a shot.after i finally watched it, i have to admit it was actually very good and comparable to the first puss in boots movie and in some cases, even better. the premise was interesting, the animation actually was pretty good, the stylized animation actually worked out pretty well (especially for the action sequences), full of new characters that were funny and cool, and had some important life lessons for everyone to remember and use in their everyday lives.so i liked the premise because puss using up eight of his nine lives and trying to get to the last wish to gain them back while also battling a bunch of other characters who want the wish sets up a cool and interesting story that'll keep you hooked to see who actually gets the wish. you can kind of guess what will happen in the end, but you still want to see what happens regardless.the animation was pretty beautiful as well because although they did not use the realistic animation of the shrek movies or the first puss in boots movie, having it stylized and more comic book-like works out well here as it makes the movie look more vivid and gives you a more fairy tale vibe. plus, there were more details they could add to the characters and the scenery as well. also, as much it kind of looked cheap, the stylized animation worked out well for some of the action scenes and made them look pretty cool and graphic and added more suspense to the fight scenes between the good guys and the bad guys.the characters were also pretty cool as well. puss (once again voiced by antonio banderas) is just as funny, cool, and energetic as he always was in the previous films, kitty softpaws (once again voiced by selma hayek) adds some great humor and banter with puss once again in his mission, and the new characters were quite interesting too. perrito, the little dog (voiced by harvey guill√©n), is pretty funny and although plays the typical annoying sidekick, his role works out pretty well here as he helps puss and kitty. goldilocks and the three bears (voiced by florence pugh, olivia colman, ray winstone, and samson kayo) add some funny humor as well and their banter with each other is quite hilarious as well. big jack horner, one of the villains (voiced by john mulaney), is certainly devious and sarcastic, and his dark humor is ironically quite funny at times (i mean, if he's voiced by mulaney, then obviously it's going to be funny, due to his rather deadpan delivery of his lines).then there's the wolf (voiced by wagner moura), who serves as the other villain in this, but way darker and more sinister than jack horner. specifically, he is really the grim reaper who is after puss for him cheating death eight times and wants to take his last life as punishment, even though puss is still alive. now, when i say this character is dark, he--is--dark! like from his red eyes to his hooded figure to his low, slow, creepy sounding voice to his spine chilling/goosebump inducing whistling to his only intention of claiming puss' last life, this is a dark villain done right and probably one of the best ones in any dreamworks movie in a long time. heck, i was surprised the directors and writers made the wolf as dark as they did as it would certainly freak out some kids, and even some adults as well. at the same time though, i'll give them credit for really stepping it up here and making a very interesting and intimidating villain, as well as not making him a surprise villain too and you knew he was a villain from the beginning (the surprise villain trope has been used too much lately and it was nice to have the obvious villain trope come back once again in my opinion). i would say if you have kids, viewer discretion is advised for the wolf's scenes, but it's just a few scenes and it's not constantly.now for the themes, they were definitely important ones that i believe we all should consider in our daily lives. i won't try to spoil anything with them, but the themes presented in the last wish involve being happy with the family you grew up with even if they're not your biological family, being around people (and animals) that you can trust, and also, accepting that death is an inevitable thing, but that means living life to the fullest and enjoying every moment of it and do not waste it. again, not trying to spoil too much, but they were presented really well in the last wish that will definitely grasp your attention and might even get you thinking about how things are going with your life and might make you consider making some better changes for yourself.alright, so i know that was a lot to say here, but i just wanted to go over everything that i liked about the last wish. i know it's been out for a while now, but for those who haven't seen it yet, i'd recommend giving it a chance because it's definitely one of the better animated movies that have come out in recent years and it's one that i'm sure you'll love instantly once you watch it. it does have its serious moments, but it has a good blend of that and humor and some touching moments that hit you in the feels. lastly, if you're a fan of puss in boots, then seeing him in action once again will definitely satisfy your movie going needs.so if you have netflix, apple tv, or any other streaming service puss in boots: the last wish is on, go watch it!!!"

","when i first heard about the last wish, and saw some of the trailers, i thought it was going to be a bit goofy and not as good as the first one (though seeing puss say ""no hablo ingl√©s"" to get out of talking to that dog made me chuckle) and the stylized animation looked cheap and kind of hurt my eyes and i wasn't that interested. however, once i saw a few clips of it, i thought it looked rather interesting and decided to give a shot.after i finally watched it, i have to admit it was actually very good and comparable to the first puss in boots movie and in some cases, even better. the premise was interesting, the animation actually was pretty good, the stylized animation actually worked out pretty well (especially for the action sequences), full of new characters that were funny and cool, and had some important life lessons for everyone to remember and use in their everyday lives.so i liked the premise because puss using up eight of his nine lives and trying to get to the last wish to gain them back while also battling a bunch of other characters who want the wish sets up a cool and interesting story that'll keep you hooked to see who actually gets the wish. you can kind of guess what will happen in the end, but you still want to see what happens regardless.the animation was pretty beautiful as well because although they did not use the realistic animation of the shrek movies or the first puss in boots movie, having it stylized and more comic book-like works out well here as it makes the movie look more vivid and gives you a more fairy tale vibe. plus, there were more details they could add to the characters and the scenery as well. also, as much it kind of looked cheap, the stylized animation worked out well for some of the action scenes and made them look pretty cool and graphic and added more suspense to the fight scenes between the good guys and the bad guys.the characters were also pretty cool as well. puss (once again voiced by antonio banderas) is just as funny, cool, and energetic as he always was in the previous films, kitty softpaws (once again voiced by selma hayek) adds some great humor and banter with puss once again in his mission, and the new characters were quite interesting too. perrito, the little dog (voiced by harvey guill√©n), is pretty funny and although plays the typical annoying sidekick, his role works out pretty well here as he helps puss and kitty. goldilocks and the three bears (voiced by florence pugh, olivia colman, ray winstone, and samson kayo) add some funny humor as well and their banter with each other is quite hilarious as well. big jack horner, one of the villains (voiced by john mulaney), is certainly devious and sarcastic, and his dark humor is ironically quite funny at times (i mean, if he's voiced by mulaney, then obviously it's going to be funny, due to his rather deadpan delivery of his lines).then there's the wolf (voiced by wagner moura), who serves as the other villain in this, but way darker and more sinister than jack horner. specifically, he is really the grim reaper who is after puss for him cheating death eight times and wants to take his last life as punishment, even though puss is still alive. now, when i say this character is dark, he--is--dark! like from his red eyes to his hooded figure to his low, slow, creepy sounding voice to his spine chilling/goosebump inducing whistling to his only intention of claiming puss' last life, this is a dark villain done right and probably one of the best ones in any dreamworks movie in a long time. heck, i was surprised the directors and writers made the wolf as dark as they did as it would certainly freak out some kids, and even some adults as well. at the same time though, i'll give them credit for really stepping it up here and making a very interesting and intimidating villain, as well as not making him a surprise villain too and you knew he was a villain from the beginning (the surprise villain trope has been used too much lately and it was nice to have the obvious villain trope come back once again in my opinion). i would say if you have kids, viewer discretion is advised for the wolf's scenes, but it's just a few scenes and it's not constantly.now for the themes, they were definitely important ones that i believe we all should consider in our daily lives. i won't try to spoil anything with them, but the themes presented in the last wish involve being happy with the family you grew up with even if they're not your biological family, being around people (and animals) that you can trust, and also, accepting that death is an inevitable thing, but that means living life to the fullest and enjoying every moment of it and do not waste it. again, not trying to spoil too much, but they were presented really well in the last wish that will definitely grasp your attention and might even get you thinking about how things are going with your life and might make you consider making some better changes for yourself.alright, so i know that was a lot to say here, but i just wanted to go over everything that i liked about the last wish. i know it's been out for a while now, but for those who haven't seen it yet, i'd recommend giving it a chance because it's definitely one of the better animated movies that have come out in recent years and it's one that i'm sure you'll love instantly once you watch it. it does have its serious moments, but it has a good blend of that and humor and some touching moments that hit you in the feels. lastly, if you're a fan of puss in boots, then seeing him in action once again will definitely satisfy your movie going needs.so if you have netflix, apple tv, or any other streaming service puss in boots: the last wish is on, go watch it!!!"

","'puss in boots: the last wish (2022)' is brilliant. teeming with energy from the moment it begins, this animated adventure is as exhilarating as it is emotionally mature. it balances its swashbuckling action, quick-witted comedy, emotional character work and surprisingly poignant musings on mortality incredibly well. there isn't a moment of the perfectly paced piece that feels out of pace. it truly is an absolute blast. it's also beautiful, with stylishly snappy animation that immediately grabs you by the collar and drags you into the colourful storybook setting. the action scenes, in particular, are a real highlight; you're sure to have a smile on your face for each and every one. except, perhaps, those involving the wolf - not because they aren't wonderful, but because they're shockingly scary. the big bad is genuinely terrifying on occasion and his introductory scene is nothing short of a masterpiece. the internal conflict he inspires in the central character is arguably what elevates the picture to another level, and the literal manifestations of this conflict are inarguably the highlights of the entire affair. the characters all have a good amount of depth to them and they're brought to life with vital voicework that never misses a beat. even the usually annoying cute sidekick is here a sincere, funny and likeable presence that adds genuine value to the narrative. there's very little not to like here. one thing that's perhaps worth mentioning is that there's one scene in which a certain character seems to have been rendered unlit, leading to a distracting sense that the shots in which they appear are literally unfinished. some of the character arcs are predictable and there are a couple of jokes that don't quite land, too. these really are very minor flaws, though. ultimately, this is a ton of fun from start to finish. it's the sort of thing that puts a smile on your face simply because of how well achieved it is. it's phenomenal."

we had to wait 11 years since the last puss boots movie came out in 2011. was it worth it? most audiences are saying yes.antonio banderas is awesome. he can do it all: drama, comedy, musical. i love how he really exaggerates the spanish accent from spain. i lived in spain for a couple of years and adore that beautiful country and its people. i laughed out loud when he properly pronounced ""gazpacho"" with the spanish theta.he and salma hayek make a natural pairing with their comedic timing and hispanic accents.listen for the voices of these talented actors: florence pugh, academy award-winner olivia colman, comedian john mulaney, harvey guillen, da'vine joy randolph, samson kayo, ray winstone, and wagner moura.i laughed out loud so many times. there is so much animated humor, as well as spoken humor.this addition to the puss in boots franchise does a great job of reminding us that puss isn't just a suave fighter, but an actual cat. there's a cuteness battle between puss and kitty that makes for another laugh-out-loud moment.the opening sequence is full of action and humor. what a way to start off a movie in a strong way!the sequence that shows how many times puss in boots died is hilarious.due to the almost non-stop action, the movie has a palpable energy.we see an interesting mixture of 2d and 3d events, keeping things interesting visually, as well as creating a more adventurous look.the story includes several groups of people who are all after the same prize: the ultimate fairytale prize of a wish. the filmmakers explained they were influenced by the famous western movie the good, the bad, and the ugly from 1966. each set of characters has its own story arc with meaningful lessons to be learned along the way.i loved the sweet moment when a certain character started to have a panic attack and was able to calm down by simply petting a soft dog. therapy dogs serve a real and valuable service for many people who need extra support.i hope this addition to the revived shrek universe means we're going to see some more of these fun characters soon.things i didn't like:
parents might get a headache from all the chaotic noise and action.some of the voices didn't match the characters' designs.too many villains and characters to keep track of.it's sad to watch puss in boots wilt under the pressure of imminent death.tips for parents:

","i can't believe it took me a year to finally see this movie. puss in boots: the last wish (pretty terrible title notwithstanding) is an animated masterpiece. it's essentially distilled the formula of what works in an animated family film to such an extent that it feels almost easy, as if the movie wrote itself.this film has such a clever, funny, charming script that hits all of the beats that families will love. you have a dashing hero, a sophisticated love interest, a cute companion, a compelling mcguffin for our characters to chase after, a fully realized and living fantasy world, fun easter eggs, and not one, not two, but three villains who all fit perfectly into the story. it's a film with great and surprisingly weighty themes about what makes life worth living, the inevitable prospect of death, about family, redemption, good and evil.one aspect of the film i really loved was how it handled its villains. we have three, as mentioned before, but all of them play a specific role and communicate pretty fantastic ideas to kids. goldilocks & the bears are the sympathetic lot tossed into villainy because of (somewhat understandable) circumstance. the big bad wolf is a personification of the inevitability of death and other aspects of evil we can't escape. and jack horner, perhaps best of all, reminds kids that no, not all people can be redeemed. some people are just purely evil and you should avoid them.the script is also super tight, full of satisfying call backs, excellent character moments for every single member of the cast...and a lot of that has to do with the animation as well.it's a year later, so you don't need anyone to tell you about how gorgeous this movie looks; into the spiderverse and its eclectic, mesmerizing 2.5d style of animation is the best thing to happen to american animation since pixar. the movie is lush, beautiful, and colourful, but also is an excellent showcase for why animation just might be our best medium of storytelling. i kept thinking of how efficient this film was with conveying information and realized, of course it is, it's animated. there's so much you can do here that you can't with live action, and this film truly internalizes that. puss in boots isn't a great movie in spite of being animated. it's a great movie because it's animated."

","'puss in boots: the last wish (2022)' is brilliant. teeming with energy from the moment it begins, this animated adventure is as exhilarating as it is emotionally mature. it balances its swashbuckling action, quick-witted comedy, emotional character work and surprisingly poignant musings on mortality incredibly well. there isn't a moment of the perfectly paced piece that feels out of pace. it truly is an absolute blast. it's also beautiful, with stylishly snappy animation that immediately grabs you by the collar and drags you into the colourful storybook setting. the action scenes, in particular, are a real highlight; you're sure to have a smile on your face for each and every one. except, perhaps, those involving the wolf - not because they aren't wonderful, but because they're shockingly scary. the big bad is genuinely terrifying on occasion and his introductory scene is nothing short of a masterpiece. the internal conflict he inspires in the central character is arguably what elevates the picture to another level, and the literal manifestations of this conflict are inarguably the highlights of the entire affair. the characters all have a good amount of depth to them and they're brought to life with vital voicework that never misses a beat. even the usually annoying cute sidekick is here a sincere, funny and likeable presence that adds genuine value to the narrative. there's very little not to like here. one thing that's perhaps worth mentioning is that there's one scene in which a certain character seems to have been rendered unlit, leading to a distracting sense that the shots in which they appear are literally unfinished. some of the character arcs are predictable and there are a couple of jokes that don't quite land, too. these really are very minor flaws, though. ultimately, this is a ton of fun from start to finish. it's the sort of thing that puts a smile on your face simply because of how well achieved it is. it's phenomenal."

puss in boots discovers that his passion for adventure has taken its toll: he has burned through eight of his nine lives. puss sets out on an epic journey to find the mythical last wish and restore his nine lives.the co-directors of the colorful dreamworks film are joel crawford and januel mercado. the screenplay was written by tommy swerdlow and paul fisher, based on the story by tom wheeler.things i liked:
we had to wait 11 years since the last puss boots movie came out in 2011. was it worth it? most audiences are saying yes.antonio banderas is awesome. he can do it all: drama, comedy, musical. i love how he really exaggerates the spanish accent from spain. i lived in spain for a couple of years and adore that beautiful country and its people. i laughed out loud when he properly pronounced ""gazpacho"" with the spanish theta.he and salma hayek make a natural pairing with their comedic timing and hispanic accents.listen for the voices of these talented actors: florence pugh, academy award-winner olivia colman, comedian john mulaney, harvey guillen, da'vine joy randolph, samson kayo, ray winstone, and wagner moura.i laughed out loud so many times. there is so much animated humor, as well as spoken humor.this addition to the puss in boots franchise does a great job of reminding us that puss isn't just a suave fighter, but an actual cat. there's a cuteness battle between puss and kitty that makes for another laugh-out-loud moment.the opening sequence is full of action and humor. what a way to start off a movie in a strong way!the sequence that shows how many times puss in boots died is hilarious.due to the almost non-stop action, the movie has a palpable energy.we see an interesting mixture of 2d and 3d events, keeping things interesting visually, as well as creating a more adventurous look.the story includes several groups of people who are all after the same prize: the ultimate fairytale prize of a wish. the filmmakers explained they were influenced by the famous western movie the good, the bad, and the ugly from 1966. each set of characters has its own story arc with meaningful lessons to be learned along the way.i loved the sweet moment when a certain character started to have a panic attack and was able to calm down by simply petting a soft dog. therapy dogs serve a real and valuable service for many people who need extra support.i hope this addition to the revived shrek universe means we're going to see some more of these fun characters soon.things i didn't like:
parents might get a headache from all the chaotic noise and action.some of the voices didn't match the characters' designs.too many villains and characters to keep track of.it's sad to watch puss in boots wilt under the pressure of imminent death.tips for parents:
this is a movie that all ages will enjoy!alcohol
cartoon violence
no profanity. there are a few times when various characters begin to swear but their words are either shushed or bleeped out.!"

","i can't believe it took me a year to finally see this movie. puss in boots: the last wish (pretty terrible title notwithstanding) is an animated masterpiece. it's essentially distilled the formula of what works in an animated family film to such an extent that it feels almost easy, as if the movie wrote itself.this film has such a clever, funny, charming script that hits all of the beats that families will love. you have a dashing hero, a sophisticated love interest, a cute companion, a compelling mcguffin for our characters to chase after, a fully realized and living fantasy world, fun easter eggs, and not one, not two, but three villains who all fit perfectly into the story. it's a film with great and surprisingly weighty themes about what makes life worth living, the inevitable prospect of death, about family, redemption, good and evil.one aspect of the film i really loved was how it handled its villains. we have three, as mentioned before, but all of them play a specific role and communicate pretty fantastic ideas to kids. goldilocks & the bears are the sympathetic lot tossed into villainy because of (somewhat understandable) circumstance. the big bad wolf is a personification of the inevitability of death and other aspects of evil we can't escape. and jack horner, perhaps best of all, reminds kids that no, not all people can be redeemed. some people are just purely evil and you should avoid them.the script is also super tight, full of satisfying call backs, excellent character moments for every single member of the cast...and a lot of that has to do with the animation as well.it's a year later, so you don't need anyone to tell you about how gorgeous this movie looks; into the spiderverse and its eclectic, mesmerizing 2.5d style of animation is the best thing to happen to american animation since pixar. the movie is lush, beautiful, and colourful, but also is an excellent showcase for why animation just might be our best medium of storytelling. i kept thinking of how efficient this film was with conveying information and realized, of course it is, it's animated. there's so much you can do here that you can't with live action, and this film truly internalizes that. puss in boots isn't a great movie in spite of being animated. it's a great movie because it's animated."
"2567","the matrix","themysteriousreviewer",2023-08-05,9," awesome than ever
","when i first heard of this movie, i thought it would be a sequel that i wouldn't mind than to just milk the shrek franchise. but honestly, i was just surprised of how awesome it turned out to be. puss in boots: the last wish is the best shrek movie we have gotten in a long time. it has made a comeback to the character eleven years later and was even better than the predecessor with an exciting and intense story, amazingly upgraded animation, likable characters, and an addition to spice up the movie with death as one of the best villains dreamworks has created. but what truly makes the movie better is with a great moral of living one life. having one life is all we all have left and we should enjoy while we last. if you love the shrek franchise (well, most likely for the first two), i think you will have a blast with this one. last year has been a great year for the studio, and i believe with this movie and the bad guys, they seem are going to start making better movies. alright dreamworks, you win. you can have shrek 5, but please make that worth it."

it's presented in a way that children will understand, but adults will truly appreciate.the lessons the characters learn are a bit predictable, but they always land with sincerity, making them effective and meaningful.overall, puss in boots the last wish is a sequel i never knew i wanted, but if this is the kind of quality and creativity this franchise is capable of, sign me up for a third film...

","this funny, charming and adorable, yet often quite dark, gloomy and intense puss in boots adventure isn't your typical cash-grabbing kids' movie. it's been over a decade since the first puss in boots movie, which was a spin-off in the shrek franchise featuring the loveable ginger cat in tiny boots wielding a mini sword. but this is unashamedly the best they've done since the first and second shrek movies.when puss in boots learns that he's already burnt through eight of his nine lives, he embarks on an epic quest to find the mythical wishing star to restore his lives. get it? because cats have nine lives? anyway, it's a pretty simple storyline that doesn't sound, and isn't really too complicated. however, this movie isn't getting all the praise for its animation techniques, vocal performances and all of that, although it definitely deserves major credit for the cast's brilliant work and the gorgeous 3d animation style that likes to pick some moments to do in a clever, witty 2d.forgivably, you can never expect a family comedy in theatres that isn't guaranteed to have its extended moments of silly humour, but these very occasional scenes don't overtake the heavy themes this movie wants to consider, which is actually life and death. there are three parties of antagonists, some who are more villainy than the others, but there's fairy tale characters goldilocks, the three bears and jack horner, and similar to the party this movie features as the protagonists, they all have meaning, struggles and thoughtful backstories to them. but it's the main villain who appears as a whistling wolf who provides the sense of dread. and when you take into consideration villain construction, appearances and overall sense of menace, he's one of the best antagonists of the year.if you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews."

","actress/writer/director emerald fennell is turning into an artistic voice that bears noticing and with saltburn - her follow-up to promising young woman (the film that won her the academy award for best original screenplay) - fennell's artistic voice is in full bloom.starring barry keoghan (oscar nominated for the banshees of inisherin), saltburn tells the story of an oxford student who befriends the rich, cool kid (jacob elordi, euphoria) who invites him back to his family compound, saltburn, for the summer with his eccentric (to say the least) family.as written and directed by fennell, saltburn is a satire on the elite rich, showing them in their extravagant, quirky isolation in their compound, looking down on the common folk from their piles of money (or...in some cases...oblivious of the common folk because of their money) while peeling back the layers to show the unhappiness and manipulation underneath.fennell layers this story richly, slowly folding back facades and layers to show the ugliness of inherently unhappy people who cover their unhappiness up with wealth, money and parties.into this world comes oliver quick (keoghan) who is the audiences' conduit into this level of living - and who has secrets of his own.keoghan is interesting to watch (as always) and the family...elordi, sadie soverall (his sister) and archie madekwe (another outsider who is jealous of oliver's appearance) all are good looking, good enough performers who live the hedonistic lifestyle and deny the consequences and responsibilities thereof.when a film needs an ""ice queen"" as the matriarch of a family, rosamund pike is, inevitably, brought in and she brings the goods to saltburn. she is perfectly cast as the mother of the family who says what she thinks, does not show what she is feeling and doesn't give a darn about anyone else. she is suitably balanced by the off-balanced, quirky performance of the always good richard e. grant as the patriarch of the family who is (usually) lost in his own little world of whatever fantasy he is currently involved in.but if this was just a film about a quirky family, it would be a fun, interesting romp. but...in fennell's hands, it becomes something much more sinister - and much more interesting - to watch.saltburn is a film that one must sit with after watching to digest what was just witnessed, but...ultimately...is one that is very interesting....and intriguing...and dark.letter grade: b+7 1/2 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the bank(ofmarquis)"

","saltburn is a crazed caricature. absurdist to the nth degree. it's punctuated with the allure of witty, pithy dialogue and outrageous characters, but the plot doesn't pull its weight through to any real finality. the shock-value is cranked up to the maximum, an overplayed hand; with only anticlimax to show for it. the payoff only lands softly as the film slowly meanders to sophie ellis-bextor's iconic early 2000s ""murder on the dancefloor"" backed credits. saltburn is a publicity stunt, it desperately wants to rile and provoke, to be talked about by urgently grabbing the viewer's attention by means of shock-value, and secondly allowing the director's more subtle commentary on class to be discovered after the fact. in its open-endedness, it struggles to justify the point of its own existence in the midst of its attention-seeking rhetoric. it tries so hard to be idiosyncratic that it at times becomes somewhat overexposed, and errs to state the obvious.the film's director, emerald fennell, hails from the same upper classes she targets. we are offered her insider's take; her ace in the hole that populates the script with hilariously classist opines, jabs, and devilish quips. fennell satirically imagines both halves of society; one half envious, clamouring, coveting, pining, self-conscious, and scheming, the other half decadent, proud, sneering, prideful, and detached. but nothing said here hasn't been said elsewhere in the ""eat-the-rich"" discussion. nonetheless, the issue is less the originality of what is said overall, but instead *how* things are said. i would say this could be the most intricate exploration and representation of class behaviour, at least in british culture, ever put to the cinema screen. this is a story of the haves and the moth-like want-mores. even despite it being quite clearly derivative from the likes of mr. ripley.saltburn's cast is a strong point, with standout performances from barry keoghan, jacob elordi, rosamund pike, and richard e. grant. but keoghan's character is ultimately a maniac without a cause. however, seen as a black comedy caricature through the lense of marxian class theory, saltburn's value can be truly felt.7.4/10."

","set in the early 2000s, oliver quick (barry keoghan) is a working-class student on scholarship to oxford where he often finds himself isolated due to the cultural divide between him and the other attending students. after befriending wealthy student felix catton (jacob elordi), oliver is invited to spend the summer at felix's family estate saltburn where he meets the eccentric catton family consisting of sir james (richard e. grant) and lady elspeth (rosmund pike), felix's siter venetia (alison oliver), and their cousin farleigh (archie madekwe) who makes no secret of his disdain for oliver. over the course of the summer, oliver ingrains himself into the lifestyle of the cattons until darker revelations reveal themselves and send ripples throughout the catton family and estate.saltburn is this sophomore feature of emerald fennell who previously made a name for herself with 2020's promising young woman. taking inspiration from country house set stories, fennell creates some characters who are despicable but also oddly compelling in a story that takes its time in setup before building to a strong and memorable finish.in terms of acting, saltburn is a fantastic showcase for an ensemble cast with not only the catton family made up of status conscious snobs whose atrocious attitudes are either worn on their sleeves or hidden behind a transparent veil of empty sympathy. all of the characters have some flaw be it in a tenuous grasp on status as is the case with farleigh, a hunger for validation in the case of venetia, or in felix's tendency to pick-up lower class ""strays"". barry keoghan is absolutely fantastic in the role of oliver quick and what starts out as a seemingly innocuous observer into this world of opulence and wealth is soon revealed to be a rich multi-layered portrayal that becomes increasingly absorbing minute by minute as keoghan has to act out certain grotesque or off-putting scenes that would be a challenge for most actors.in terms of the writing, saltburn initially seems like it's trying to position itself as an ""eat the rich"" type story in the vein of the menu or glass onion, but while that element is there i'd say the movie has more in common with the works of patricia highsmith in how it becomes a psychological game of wits as filtered through this satirical drama in a countryside house. i can't give too much away but the movie builds an uneasy voyeuristic atmosphere that culminates in a devious and wicked ending. the movie won't be for everyone as there are sequences that are difficult to watch due to how uncomfortable they are (even if they are well acted), and scenes involving a bathtub or late night rendezvous in the garden will definitely not be for the squeamish.while saltburn took its time in setting up its story, i was ultimately satisfied with the route it took and the payoff it built up to. the movie features excellent acting across the board especially from its lead barry keoghan who creates one of the most memorably off-putting protagonists i've seen in some time."

","saltburnif one were looking for a definition of tastelessness in cinematic form then i would suggest this effort as a worthy candidate. one should note that it's not particularly worthy in many other respects, with the notable exception of its cinematography and set design; these happen to be the only areas where any true care appears to have been given. for example, there are some arresting uses of shadow, and a variety of visually stimulating locations but there endeth the praise, almost...i also wish to make some positive remarks regarding the performance of rosamund pike, who, to my mind, is an extraordinary actress who hasn't received the filmic exposure that her talents merit. her icy charisma and ability to appear authentic in pretty much any role she undertakes makes her scenes one of the very few pleasures this movie bestows.now onto the problems. firstly, there are the characters. the fact that none of them, except possibly pike's, appears credible is not actually the film's biggest issue; what is much more dissatisfying is that none of the relationships in the film are even marginally convincing. there is not an iota of chemistry between any of the film's characters and that especially applies to the relationship which occupies the film's central focus, that between oliver (barry keoghan) and felix (jacob elordi). now it's easy for one to excuse this by referring to how emotionally dysfunctional oliver and felix (as well as the entirety of felix's family) appear to be, but that would be to miss the point. there isn't even any superficial connection or slight moment of feeling that is generated between oliver and felix which would make you believe that they would bother to utter a morning greeting to each other, never mind about the idea that one would invite the other to his family home. the issue here is not with the acting but with the pacing, the writing and, most significantly, the film's incessantly odious tone.the general misanthropy and nastiness that pervades each scene does not provide any space for the actors to begin to cultivate any sense of fine feeling, or feeling of any kind in fact, for each other. oliver talks about loving and being in love at the beginning of the film but all we are truly presented with is an emotionally barren wasteland of unconvincing characters being placed in unconvincing scenarios doing and saying unconvincingly horrid things to one another. there is no emotional texture to draw on, there's no empathy, no joy, no connection, and, thus, there are no stakes. it is simply impossible to care what becomes of any of the characters because the film never allowed any of the characters to become anything in the first place.some of this would've been redeemed if the film was at least humorous. however, i'm afraid that, despite a number of obvious and jarring attempts, humour was never experienced for this viewer. the film was in fact painfully humourless. after all, it's hard to laugh at scenarios which are neither persuasive nor engaging.a word should be spoken on the casting of barry keoghan as the film's protagonist. yes, he was probably miscast. his liverpudlian accent is inconsistent and while he does creepy and arresting extremely well in other films, he possesses none of the oily charm or comfortingly sympathetic demeanour his character requires. matt damon does a much better job in a film with similar themes: the talented mr ripley. he demonstrates a boyish innocence and exuberance alongside an unnatural cunning which makes him endearing and credible and thus draws him into a world to which someone of his station would normally be barred entry. keoghan's oliver, on the other hand, one would not wish to touch with a barge pole, and, if one did, one would run away from him as soon as one had found oneself doing so. however, the casting of keoghan only serves to speak to larger faults with the film. he was unsuitable, it's true, but so was the entire movie.so, what seemed as if it might have been a worthwhile, visceral investigation of the way class and privilege operate in 21st century britain ends up being an ugly, uninteresting, vicious mess. its plot begins as muddy and ends as being ridiculous to the point of insult, so insulting, in fact, that i shan't bother to offer any further comment on it. its sense of place is much weaker than it ought to be, bearing in mind that the film's title is eponymous with it, and its sense of time is utterly arbitrary (was it set around 2006 just so the director got to include her favourite tunes? i can't think of any other reason). thus, the overall effect of the film is to inspire very little outside of boredom and jaded disgust.4/10 (3 points for rosamund and 1 for the pretty colours and sets)"

"2635","the matrix","ionicbreezemachine",2023-12-23,8," emerald fennell creates an engaging and uncomfortable psychological satirical thriller with gothic undertones and shades of patricia highsmith
","set in the early 2000s, oliver quick (barry keoghan) is a working-class student on scholarship to oxford where he often finds himself isolated due to the cultural divide between him and the other attending students. after befriending wealthy student felix catton (jacob elordi), oliver is invited to spend the summer at felix's family estate saltburn where he meets the eccentric catton family consisting of sir james (richard e. grant) and lady elspeth (rosmund pike), felix's siter venetia (alison oliver), and their cousin farleigh (archie madekwe) who makes no secret of his disdain for oliver. over the course of the summer, oliver ingrains himself into the lifestyle of the cattons until darker revelations reveal themselves and send ripples throughout the catton family and estate.saltburn is this sophomore feature of emerald fennell who previously made a name for herself with 2020's promising young woman. taking inspiration from country house set stories, fennell creates some characters who are despicable but also oddly compelling in a story that takes its time in setup before building to a strong and memorable finish.in terms of acting, saltburn is a fantastic showcase for an ensemble cast with not only the catton family made up of status conscious snobs whose atrocious attitudes are either worn on their sleeves or hidden behind a transparent veil of empty sympathy. all of the characters have some flaw be it in a tenuous grasp on status as is the case with farleigh, a hunger for validation in the case of venetia, or in felix's tendency to pick-up lower class ""strays"". barry keoghan is absolutely fantastic in the role of oliver quick and what starts out as a seemingly innocuous observer into this world of opulence and wealth is soon revealed to be a rich multi-layered portrayal that becomes increasingly absorbing minute by minute as keoghan has to act out certain grotesque or off-putting scenes that would be a challenge for most actors.in terms of the writing, saltburn initially seems like it's trying to position itself as an ""eat the rich"" type story in the vein of the menu or glass onion, but while that element is there i'd say the movie has more in common with the works of patricia highsmith in how it becomes a psychological game of wits as filtered through this satirical drama in a countryside house. i can't give too much away but the movie builds an uneasy voyeuristic atmosphere that culminates in a devious and wicked ending. the movie won't be for everyone as there are sequences that are difficult to watch due to how uncomfortable they are (even if they are well acted), and scenes involving a bathtub or late night rendezvous in the garden will definitely not be for the squeamish.while saltburn took its time in setting up its story, i was ultimately satisfied with the route it took and the payoff it built up to. the movie features excellent acting across the board especially from its lead barry keoghan who creates one of the most memorably off-putting protagonists i've seen in some time."

","saltburnif one were looking for a definition of tastelessness in cinematic form then i would suggest this effort as a worthy candidate. one should note that it's not particularly worthy in many other respects, with the notable exception of its cinematography and set design; these happen to be the only areas where any true care appears to have been given. for example, there are some arresting uses of shadow, and a variety of visually stimulating locations but there endeth the praise, almost...i also wish to make some positive remarks regarding the performance of rosamund pike, who, to my mind, is an extraordinary actress who hasn't received the filmic exposure that her talents merit. her icy charisma and ability to appear authentic in pretty much any role she undertakes makes her scenes one of the very few pleasures this movie bestows.now onto the problems. firstly, there are the characters. the fact that none of them, except possibly pike's, appears credible is not actually the film's biggest issue; what is much more dissatisfying is that none of the relationships in the film are even marginally convincing. there is not an iota of chemistry between any of the film's characters and that especially applies to the relationship which occupies the film's central focus, that between oliver (barry keoghan) and felix (jacob elordi). now it's easy for one to excuse this by referring to how emotionally dysfunctional oliver and felix (as well as the entirety of felix's family) appear to be, but that would be to miss the point. there isn't even any superficial connection or slight moment of feeling that is generated between oliver and felix which would make you believe that they would bother to utter a morning greeting to each other, never mind about the idea that one would invite the other to his family home. the issue here is not with the acting but with the pacing, the writing and, most significantly, the film's incessantly odious tone.the general misanthropy and nastiness that pervades each scene does not provide any space for the actors to begin to cultivate any sense of fine feeling, or feeling of any kind in fact, for each other. oliver talks about loving and being in love at the beginning of the film but all we are truly presented with is an emotionally barren wasteland of unconvincing characters being placed in unconvincing scenarios doing and saying unconvincingly horrid things to one another. there is no emotional texture to draw on, there's no empathy, no joy, no connection, and, thus, there are no stakes. it is simply impossible to care what becomes of any of the characters because the film never allowed any of the characters to become anything in the first place.some of this would've been redeemed if the film was at least humorous. however, i'm afraid that, despite a number of obvious and jarring attempts, humour was never experienced for this viewer. the film was in fact painfully humourless. after all, it's hard to laugh at scenarios which are neither persuasive nor engaging.a word should be spoken on the casting of barry keoghan as the film's protagonist. yes, he was probably miscast. his liverpudlian accent is inconsistent and while he does creepy and arresting extremely well in other films, he possesses none of the oily charm or comfortingly sympathetic demeanour his character requires. matt damon does a much better job in a film with similar themes: the talented mr ripley. he demonstrates a boyish innocence and exuberance alongside an unnatural cunning which makes him endearing and credible and thus draws him into a world to which someone of his station would normally be barred entry. keoghan's oliver, on the other hand, one would not wish to touch with a barge pole, and, if one did, one would run away from him as soon as one had found oneself doing so. however, the casting of keoghan only serves to speak to larger faults with the film. he was unsuitable, it's true, but so was the entire movie.so, what seemed as if it might have been a worthwhile, visceral investigation of the way class and privilege operate in 21st century britain ends up being an ugly, uninteresting, vicious mess. its plot begins as muddy and ends as being ridiculous to the point of insult, so insulting, in fact, that i shan't bother to offer any further comment on it. its sense of place is much weaker than it ought to be, bearing in mind that the film's title is eponymous with it, and its sense of time is utterly arbitrary (was it set around 2006 just so the director got to include her favourite tunes? i can't think of any other reason). thus, the overall effect of the film is to inspire very little outside of boredom and jaded disgust.4/10 (3 points for rosamund and 1 for the pretty colours and sets)"

","barry keoghan plays oliver, a quiet introvert on a scholarship at oxford university, who becomes enamoured by the cool and popular guy on campus felix (played by jacob elordi). a chance encounter allows the two to meet and become friends, and when a family tragedy strikes oliver, he is invited by felix to stay at his family's manor 'saltburn' over the summer break. there we are introduced to felix's' eccentric but equally alluring family. oliver is intimidated by each of them, but desperately wants to fit in too, and over the course of the film, his character and values change as the debauchery increases. the film includes plenty of sex, drugs, death and twists to keep the audience both entertained and intrigued throughout, but there is also a high level of shock value that may put people off as well.i'd briefly seen the trailer when it was first released, but had soon forgotten about it, and since the film's official release, all i've heard is how wild and unexpected it is. of course i had to give it a go to see what all the fuss was about. i must say, i agree with all the comments, but aside from how wild it is, its actually an amazing film, full of complex characters.rosamund pike is a great actor, and she's chosen some pretty iconic roles in her career. her portrayal of felix's mother elspeth continues that trend, and the character was worthy of her own film. elspeth reminded me so much of belinda bromilow's aunt elizabeth from 'the great' and her accent was positively delightful. she delivered some scene stealing one liners, and i really hope she garners more than a few awards for the role.jacob elordi is proving to be a versatile actor, and although his english accent wasn't a complete fail, it sounded obviously put on. he also looked 5 meters tall next to the vertically challenged barry keoghan. felix was the epitome of a golden boy, who had everything. girls want to date him, guys wanted to be him (and let's face it, date him too) and he was effortlessly charming.at first, barry keoghan looked too old to be playing a college student, and although in real life he is 31, if i were told he was 51, i'd believe it. i was impressed by his acting, and he played the shy and eager-to-please character so well. i really connected with oliver when he first arrived at saltburn, as it reminded me of being invited on holidays with a friend's family and wanting to be accepted by them. when oliver's character suddenly changes half way through the film, it was unexpected and a little unnerving. there were some subtle hints at a werewolf or a jekyll and hide story that didn't eventuate, but the film could have easily taken either direction. oliver was such an interesting character who evoked empathy from the audience for most of the film. it was a real ballsy (pun intended) performance from keoghan, one that he will be remembered for throughout his career.alison oliver as felix's sister venetia gets an honourable mention, as she was one of the more complex characters who was given some tough material to work with.one of the many highlights for me was the film's cinematography. it's choices of colour, lighting and setting showed romance, grandeur and so much emotion. there were several shots that would make amazing pieces of art as stills, and i enjoyed the symbolism throughout such as the frequent use of mirror images and reflections. the costuming was also great, especially those worn by the women. there was an awesome soundtrack too from the early 2000's, and the use of sophie ellis-bexter's hit 'murder on the dancefloor' in the final scene was the icing on the cake.the only negatives i had with this film were some of the more controversial and graphic scenes (the details of which i will not spoil), which i understand added to the tone of the film, but to me, were a bit too gross and confronting. the other negative i had was how they used (or didn't) the brilliant carey mulligan. her character of poor dear pamela looked to be just as iconic as elspeth in her first scene, however it was her only scene, and she was quickly written out of the rest of the film. i understand cameos, but don't give such a celebrated actor a great role, only for it to be 20 seconds of screen time or less.saltburn stands as a testament to the artistry of modern cinema, radiating an aura of darkness and mystery, with a narrative that is as seductive as it is intriguing and shocking. it embraces its provocative nature but gives its characters purpose as well as beauty that shines through."

"2654","the matrix","ionicbreezemachine",2023-12-23,8," emerald fennell creates an engaging and uncomfortable psychological satirical thriller with gothic undertones and shades of patricia highsmith
","set in the early 2000s, oliver quick (barry keoghan) is a working-class student on scholarship to oxford where he often finds himself isolated due to the cultural divide between him and the other attending students. after befriending wealthy student felix catton (jacob elordi), oliver is invited to spend the summer at felix's family estate saltburn where he meets the eccentric catton family consisting of sir james (richard e. grant) and lady elspeth (rosmund pike), felix's siter venetia (alison oliver), and their cousin farleigh (archie madekwe) who makes no secret of his disdain for oliver. over the course of the summer, oliver ingrains himself into the lifestyle of the cattons until darker revelations reveal themselves and send ripples throughout the catton family and estate.saltburn is this sophomore feature of emerald fennell who previously made a name for herself with 2020's promising young woman. taking inspiration from country house set stories, fennell creates some characters who are despicable but also oddly compelling in a story that takes its time in setup before building to a strong and memorable finish.in terms of acting, saltburn is a fantastic showcase for an ensemble cast with not only the catton family made up of status conscious snobs whose atrocious attitudes are either worn on their sleeves or hidden behind a transparent veil of empty sympathy. all of the characters have some flaw be it in a tenuous grasp on status as is the case with farleigh, a hunger for validation in the case of venetia, or in felix's tendency to pick-up lower class ""strays"". barry keoghan is absolutely fantastic in the role of oliver quick and what starts out as a seemingly innocuous observer into this world of opulence and wealth is soon revealed to be a rich multi-layered portrayal that becomes increasingly absorbing minute by minute as keoghan has to act out certain grotesque or off-putting scenes that would be a challenge for most actors.in terms of the writing, saltburn initially seems like it's trying to position itself as an ""eat the rich"" type story in the vein of the menu or glass onion, but while that element is there i'd say the movie has more in common with the works of patricia highsmith in how it becomes a psychological game of wits as filtered through this satirical drama in a countryside house. i can't give too much away but the movie builds an uneasy voyeuristic atmosphere that culminates in a devious and wicked ending. the movie won't be for everyone as there are sequences that are difficult to watch due to how uncomfortable they are (even if they are well acted), and scenes involving a bathtub or late night rendezvous in the garden will definitely not be for the squeamish.while saltburn took its time in setting up its story, i was ultimately satisfied with the route it took and the payoff it built up to. the movie features excellent acting across the board especially from its lead barry keoghan who creates one of the most memorably off-putting protagonists i've seen in some time."

","saltburnif one were looking for a definition of tastelessness in cinematic form then i would suggest this effort as a worthy candidate. one should note that it's not particularly worthy in many other respects, with the notable exception of its cinematography and set design; these happen to be the only areas where any true care appears to have been given. for example, there are some arresting uses of shadow, and a variety of visually stimulating locations but there endeth the praise, almost...i also wish to make some positive remarks regarding the performance of rosamund pike, who, to my mind, is an extraordinary actress who hasn't received the filmic exposure that her talents merit. her icy charisma and ability to appear authentic in pretty much any role she undertakes makes her scenes one of the very few pleasures this movie bestows.now onto the problems. firstly, there are the characters. the fact that none of them, except possibly pike's, appears credible is not actually the film's biggest issue; what is much more dissatisfying is that none of the relationships in the film are even marginally convincing. there is not an iota of chemistry between any of the film's characters and that especially applies to the relationship which occupies the film's central focus, that between oliver (barry keoghan) and felix (jacob elordi). now it's easy for one to excuse this by referring to how emotionally dysfunctional oliver and felix (as well as the entirety of felix's family) appear to be, but that would be to miss the point. there isn't even any superficial connection or slight moment of feeling that is generated between oliver and felix which would make you believe that they would bother to utter a morning greeting to each other, never mind about the idea that one would invite the other to his family home. the issue here is not with the acting but with the pacing, the writing and, most significantly, the film's incessantly odious tone.the general misanthropy and nastiness that pervades each scene does not provide any space for the actors to begin to cultivate any sense of fine feeling, or feeling of any kind in fact, for each other. oliver talks about loving and being in love at the beginning of the film but all we are truly presented with is an emotionally barren wasteland of unconvincing characters being placed in unconvincing scenarios doing and saying unconvincingly horrid things to one another. there is no emotional texture to draw on, there's no empathy, no joy, no connection, and, thus, there are no stakes. it is simply impossible to care what becomes of any of the characters because the film never allowed any of the characters to become anything in the first place.some of this would've been redeemed if the film was at least humorous. however, i'm afraid that, despite a number of obvious and jarring attempts, humour was never experienced for this viewer. the film was in fact painfully humourless. after all, it's hard to laugh at scenarios which are neither persuasive nor engaging.a word should be spoken on the casting of barry keoghan as the film's protagonist. yes, he was probably miscast. his liverpudlian accent is inconsistent and while he does creepy and arresting extremely well in other films, he possesses none of the oily charm or comfortingly sympathetic demeanour his character requires. matt damon does a much better job in a film with similar themes: the talented mr ripley. he demonstrates a boyish innocence and exuberance alongside an unnatural cunning which makes him endearing and credible and thus draws him into a world to which someone of his station would normally be barred entry. keoghan's oliver, on the other hand, one would not wish to touch with a barge pole, and, if one did, one would run away from him as soon as one had found oneself doing so. however, the casting of keoghan only serves to speak to larger faults with the film. he was unsuitable, it's true, but so was the entire movie.so, what seemed as if it might have been a worthwhile, visceral investigation of the way class and privilege operate in 21st century britain ends up being an ugly, uninteresting, vicious mess. its plot begins as muddy and ends as being ridiculous to the point of insult, so insulting, in fact, that i shan't bother to offer any further comment on it. its sense of place is much weaker than it ought to be, bearing in mind that the film's title is eponymous with it, and its sense of time is utterly arbitrary (was it set around 2006 just so the director got to include her favourite tunes? i can't think of any other reason). thus, the overall effect of the film is to inspire very little outside of boredom and jaded disgust.4/10 (3 points for rosamund and 1 for the pretty colours and sets)"

","barry keoghan plays oliver, a quiet introvert on a scholarship at oxford university, who becomes enamoured by the cool and popular guy on campus felix (played by jacob elordi). a chance encounter allows the two to meet and become friends, and when a family tragedy strikes oliver, he is invited by felix to stay at his family's manor 'saltburn' over the summer break. there we are introduced to felix's' eccentric but equally alluring family. oliver is intimidated by each of them, but desperately wants to fit in too, and over the course of the film, his character and values change as the debauchery increases. the film includes plenty of sex, drugs, death and twists to keep the audience both entertained and intrigued throughout, but there is also a high level of shock value that may put people off as well.i'd briefly seen the trailer when it was first released, but had soon forgotten about it, and since the film's official release, all i've heard is how wild and unexpected it is. of course i had to give it a go to see what all the fuss was about. i must say, i agree with all the comments, but aside from how wild it is, its actually an amazing film, full of complex characters.rosamund pike is a great actor, and she's chosen some pretty iconic roles in her career. her portrayal of felix's mother elspeth continues that trend, and the character was worthy of her own film. elspeth reminded me so much of belinda bromilow's aunt elizabeth from 'the great' and her accent was positively delightful. she delivered some scene stealing one liners, and i really hope she garners more than a few awards for the role.jacob elordi is proving to be a versatile actor, and although his english accent wasn't a complete fail, it sounded obviously put on. he also looked 5 meters tall next to the vertically challenged barry keoghan. felix was the epitome of a golden boy, who had everything. girls want to date him, guys wanted to be him (and let's face it, date him too) and he was effortlessly charming.at first, barry keoghan looked too old to be playing a college student, and although in real life he is 31, if i were told he was 51, i'd believe it. i was impressed by his acting, and he played the shy and eager-to-please character so well. i really connected with oliver when he first arrived at saltburn, as it reminded me of being invited on holidays with a friend's family and wanting to be accepted by them. when oliver's character suddenly changes half way through the film, it was unexpected and a little unnerving. there were some subtle hints at a werewolf or a jekyll and hide story that didn't eventuate, but the film could have easily taken either direction. oliver was such an interesting character who evoked empathy from the audience for most of the film. it was a real ballsy (pun intended) performance from keoghan, one that he will be remembered for throughout his career.alison oliver as felix's sister venetia gets an honourable mention, as she was one of the more complex characters who was given some tough material to work with.one of the many highlights for me was the film's cinematography. it's choices of colour, lighting and setting showed romance, grandeur and so much emotion. there were several shots that would make amazing pieces of art as stills, and i enjoyed the symbolism throughout such as the frequent use of mirror images and reflections. the costuming was also great, especially those worn by the women. there was an awesome soundtrack too from the early 2000's, and the use of sophie ellis-bexter's hit 'murder on the dancefloor' in the final scene was the icing on the cake.the only negatives i had with this film were some of the more controversial and graphic scenes (the details of which i will not spoil), which i understand added to the tone of the film, but to me, were a bit too gross and confronting. the other negative i had was how they used (or didn't) the brilliant carey mulligan. her character of poor dear pamela looked to be just as iconic as elspeth in her first scene, however it was her only scene, and she was quickly written out of the rest of the film. i understand cameos, but don't give such a celebrated actor a great role, only for it to be 20 seconds of screen time or less.saltburn stands as a testament to the artistry of modern cinema, radiating an aura of darkness and mystery, with a narrative that is as seductive as it is intriguing and shocking. it embraces its provocative nature but gives its characters purpose as well as beauty that shines through."

"2692","the matrix","wsskfqy",2024-01-11,10," well i liked it and thought it disgusting.
","i've been reading the reviews and admiring the film aficionados. they certainly know their stuff and have a lot of films to compare it to. they know the actors' previous performances and comparable films. kudos.unless a film is extraordinary, i will have forgotten it and its title within days of watching it. the closest i get to knowing an actor is recognising their face from another film and looking up to seeing what films they played in.coming at it from that perspective, i really liked (and disliked?) this film. i can usually always guess the ""bad guy"" in films. in this film i couldn't tell who was the bad guy.oliver was creepy from the start. he was obviously obsessed with felix. but you couldn't tell if it was hero adoration, brotherly love or lust. felix was nice - for being upperclass. the rest of felix's crowd were snobby and condescending and rude, but felix seemed to genuinely like oliver. whether he liked oliver or whether it was like having an exotic pet was never clear.oliver gets to saltburn and this is where other reviewers seem to get a bit irate. actually, i thought the screenwriting might be pretty accurate. the family was... well a family. a family with far too much money and nothing to do except relieve their boredom. with nothing to do and probably not much exposure to the real world, i can see a summer there being pretty much the way it was. and with little exposure to the real world, oliver's tales of his dreadful life (divulged to felix in confidence) made oliver the exotic he was.naturally, anyone would want to stay there, with his idol, felix, so oliver tries to get in everyone's good graces in whatever way he can, including turning on the charm & seduction skills. which just makes him more creepy.but it's never clear to me why. because he loves felix and wants to be with him? as a brother? a lover? to be him? was the bathtub scene sexual or trying to somehow absorb felix's essence to be more like him?the scene with the sister could be interpreted the same way. was he trying to win her over, help her, or humiliate her?his motive for acceptance was clear, but why he wanted to be accepted never was. so, logically, i at least tentatively accepted that he wanted to be included in the rich lifestyle with felix, as part of felix's life.i really liked felix and thought the character was genuinely nice, if a bit self- absorbed. no, i don't think he was even that. he would notice when felix needed help - and he would help without hesitation. but felix was obviously into girls, so it couldn't have been a partner oliver was angling for. oliver never asked for anything, so that left a hero or a brother.i don't really want to do spoilers, though people may have already seen them.but there are twists that change the direction of the plot so you don't know where it's going at all. i didn't see the twists coming. and every moving we watch, i guess what is going to happen and disgust my partner when it happens.the very end was lame and i don't believe for a minute that the police wouldn't have been called and oliver found out. and even the very very end was just a contradiction. earlier in the movie everyone had seemed impressed with his nude body.parts. the nudity at the end...it wasn't that impressive. i think the dancing through the house scene was to make viewers wonder if he had murdered the snooty butler.that's the mystery we will never get the answer to.it was beautifully filmed, beautiful costumes, great acting (except oliver, but maybe he is really not a creepy guy and worked hard to be so creepy). great settings and good music.yes, there were some ewww moments. but in my opinion, they weren't there just to shock but to keep viewers confused as to who oliver really was and what he was about."

","saltburn is a great and entertaining movie.it has all a masterpiece needs: great acting, and an intriguing storyline, a special atmosphere and an amazing scenery.a young and ordinary scholar from oxford sneaks himself into an aristocrat family where he tries to please and adapt, hopelessly trying to become part of the group.weird scenes unfold and the feeling alternates between awkward and funny. you don't really get what exactly is happening and always wonder what the story has still to offer. as other ""ordinarys"" surrounding the family get thrown out for shallow reasons and members of the family begin to die, a suspicion grows. but it's still not clear, as the main character seemes to be devastated about the death of felix. in the end everything falls apart.ending here it would be a great movie. you could talk about what you think happened. and the discussion could begin, what it was about: i think it could best be seen as an allegory to modern day capitalism and it's mechanisms destroying everything from inside out.also it could be a symbol for the difficulties of modern day humans to connect in a meaningful way and the somehow growing distance in a world where everything seems so close and everything can be achieved.like that it would've been a masterpiece for me. unfortunately they decided minutes from the end to include a flashback where everything gets explained and every ambiguities gets destroyed. a very cheap way to explain the twist, that beforehand was laid down so nice and quietly all throughout the film. somehow the movie destroys all that for cheap reasons - ironically its fate is very similar to its characters.while i was honestly dissapointed by the ending, its still a good movie, just not the masterpiece it could've been."

"2700","the matrix","danlawson146",2023-11-18,8," deliciously wicked and messed up
","positives:1) the performances are all brilliant, in the sense that you pretty much hate everybody and that is seemingly what the film wants. i did, however, think jacob elordi was a particular standout due to completely hiding his natural australian accent and through his ability to make felix into what i felt was by far the most likeable character of the film
2) the film is hilarious in the first half. the audience i saw it with gave choruses of laughter constantly throughout the first half of the film and i really wasn't expecting it to be so funny so that was a pleasant surprise
3) the twist that oliver has been lying the whole time and planned everything to turn out the way it did certainly surprised me. i thought he was going to turn evil but i thought it was going to be caused by the events of the film, rather than the events actually being orchestrated by him the whole time. that final scene of him will also be very memorable for a long time to come
4) the film looks and sounds spectacular. the cinematography, production design, choice of aspect ratio, score etc were all superbnegatives:1) barry keoghan's scouse accent was pretty terrible and honestly distracting for a lot of the film. why couldn't oliver just be irish?2) the film didn't quite stick the landing for me. i think it would've been better if the multiple deaths that occur were scattered throughout the film, rather than them all happening in the last half an hour or so as the film rushes towards a conclusion. oliver goes from being cast out by felix to owning all of saltburn in what seems like far too short a space of time
3) i enjoyed the film very much on a surface level but i didn't really feel like the film said much of note or had much of a message. the themes around posh people who come from old money being rude and spoilt, or about how the quest for money and power can corrupt people, are all quite generic and things we've seen a lot in other films before."
"2701","joker","tvpotatocat",2019-10-15,7," i would not call it a masterpiece as some did
","there is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. i must praise phoenix's superb acting. he managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. i really think it's a role only few could do. it was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.but...there wasn't anything too complex about arthur's mental state. no deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. could it be that i was expecting too much? very possible since i came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.
what doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original joker. he felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. he didn't have the master mind that so much designated the joker and made him different from a simple murderer.
another thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.
also i found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the joker played in them. even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.
in conclusion, i can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. but as a movie about the joker i felt it was lacking. lacking the things that made the joker actually the joker, and not just another crazy murderer."

","i have seen joker yesterday at venice an early ill-fated screening. we had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.joker deserved to be presented at venice film festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.it focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. and thus, joaquin phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.
it's a take on the joker that differs from ledger's, but i'd say that both are equally as good. the main difference might be that ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while phoenix's is insane to the root.despite being a movie about a superhero villain, joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (i'd exclude the dark knight trilogy only, but joker is easily as good as nolan's movies, or at least very close). it is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to scorsese's 'taxi driver' and his 'the king of comedy', but also chaplin's 'modern times' is somewhat referenced).i am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by todd phillips. this movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by dolor y gloria or once upon a time in hollywood), and that should be very convincing."

","in the non-canonical origin story joker, joaquin phoenix plays a deeply disturbed man named arthur fleck as he experiences through a series of traumas that turn him into the notorious supervillain.phoenix is terrific as the agonized loser with a compulsive-laughter condition. he's weird and creepy and full of angst and anger and self-loathing and everyone-else-loathing.the first half hour is simply a grinding, agonizingly slow moving portrayal of arthur's life. then there's a moment of stunning, electrifying violence. and then everything gets tedious again.joker is not a supervillain movie, it's an artsy character study, and if you like those then this might appeal to you. but there's a superficiality to it all. arthur is deeply disturbed and living in a city where society's have-nots are increasingly disenfranchised, but the script and director don't really seem to have anything to say about mental illness or inequality and injustice.in the run-up to the film, director todd phillips criticized ""woke"" culture and the far left, and perhaps that's part of the problem. woke culture says we need to think about things deeply, and phillips really, really seem loathe to delve into what it means to be mentally unstable and poor in the greater societal sense. he's only concerned with how it effects arthur. arthur is also only concerned with how it effects arthur, and the result is a film that seems to accept that arthur is a victim of an unjust society while never really considering why the society is unjust or how much of arthur's problems might be the result of his own narcissistic self pity.but the main problem with the movie is it's slow-moving and dull far more often than not. i wouldn't recommend it."

","i did not have many expectations going into this with my daughter, i've seen the main shrek movies but noon of the other puss in boot's spin-offs. i was shocked at how good a movie this was when the credits rolled!the story itself is functional, but all characters are given meaningful and relatable arcs. between the melanchonic puss reaching the end of his days as a great hero, his always positive dog sidekick and the 3 antagonistic parties trying to reach the magical macguffin there is a lot going on and none of it feels forced in.the two greatest assets the movie brings is it's humor and the stunning action scenes. first of all, this movie has bite, it is back to the tone of the first shrek movie with lots of jokes that are working on a children and adult level of understanding. while the story is easy to follow for kids, the themes explored are relatively mature and will keep adults engaged.secondly, while disney/pixar movies lately fail to make action exiting with their polished cgi style, puss in boots goes full into the spiderverse once a fight breaks out. glorious 12 frames per second, hyper stylized with all the filters and gimmicks necessary to elevate the big set-pieces to something truly special and memorable. especially puss's duels against a mysterious bounty hunter are the highlights.while not entirely original, the puss in boots: the last wish combines the edgy humor of shrek with the visual wonders of into the spiderverse and strings it along a relatively matured heroes journey coming to it's end tale that is closer to logan than any other animation i can think off. oh and just in case (not that i personally care much about it) there is zero political agenda to be found here to be a distraction of the perception."

","in an age when movie and tv franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (i'm looking at you, disney), i don't think anyone was expecting much from puss in boots: the last wish - certainly not i.after the first 5 minutes, i knew this was something special.firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from arkane and enter the spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. the 2d elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.the music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).the dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling i think i've ever seen. in a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. the cast do a great job of selling them too. goldi and the bears come out with brilliant british-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.and then there's the wolf. this character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. his style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, i'm serious).at a time when disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - dreamworks have taken on the mantle.it made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. you might think i'm overselling it, but hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.there are those that say that hollywood is done - i know i do. but dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

-very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.adorable characters/feel
-new characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-the feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-has that element of shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.the animation
-it's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy dreamworks does so well.-the design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-the world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that i certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-and it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than disney for the blend of real and cartoons.the voice acting:
-many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that snl like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. he own the horner character and brought some of the best lines.-wagner moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the big-bad wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-pugh is okay, not my favorite role as goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. it does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-banderas takes boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the spanish stereotype. and yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.the references/jokes
-the stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of shrek.-it's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-the fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-it feels like the first two shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. again, refreshing that they were able to step back.the designs changes to an extent
-creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-like into the spiderverse? good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that puss does.-not overused, which is very good for me.the action at times
-shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-this movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-the ending fight shows the potential of what dreamworks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes i've seen this year.the heart
-lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-the movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-there are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. that's hard to do in many things.-i love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-have not felt this way since shrek 2.dislikes:the darkness
-it's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.predictable
-the lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-the movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.too many antagonists
-one of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-they do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.the comedy is still tapered
-it's starting to go back to shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made shrek, shrek.-they took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.the animation changes at times
-the animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-the comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.the action still not complete
--shrek and shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-this movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-the stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-they sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-often was shorter than i wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.the verdict
i must say, puss in boots: the last wish was a much better film than when i walked in. perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. it evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. and it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. this film is indeed a solid return to the world and i had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. however, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance i was looking for. the movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with puss in boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. and the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the shrek that we saw in the first two movies. still, i do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

","i did not expect the sequel to a decent spin-off dreamworks film from over a decade ago to be one of the most poignant, introspective, genuinely hilarious, and heartwarming films of the year. but here we are.after an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, the last wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. the film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.the screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. and it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.what i also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.i adored this film. i think it's dreamworks' best film since megamind and it's easily the best true family film of the year."

""the last wish"" expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the oscar-nominated 2011 original ""puss in boots."" joining banderas and his longtime friend and co-star salma hayek pinault are florence pugh, olivia colman, ray winstone, da'vine joy randolph, and john mulaney, among many others. they bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor. but of course, the fast-paced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director joel crawford and co-director januel mercado's film. the film's aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences, especially during the action sequences, but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight. from the moss growing on a fearsome forest giant to the shiny silkiness of puss' whiskers blowing in the wind, ""the last wish"" offers a variety of eye-popping details. and it frequently features dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves to transition from past to present or one scene to the next. but the film also manages to convey messages of selflessness and teamwork in a way that doesn't feel heavy-handed or cloying. and the stellar voice performances and dazzling visuals keep things so engaging you won't need a laser pointer or a catnip-stuffed mouse toy to entertain you."

","the last ""puss in boots"" movie was made 11 years ago, as well as the last film the ""shrek"" franchise, so surely they couldn't make something really great again, right? the story is pretty standard, as puss in boots is down to his last life and tries to get a wish on a magic star. it seriously has some of the best action i've seen in a long time. i don't even think this film qualifies as a comedy. it really is more like a straightforward action flick. even its first five minutes are nothing but nonstop action from frame 1 to frame...whatever.this film does not take place before the shrek films. we get to see some brief flashbacks with shrek himself, albeit only for a few seconds. the villains are big jack horner, goldilocks and the three bears, and a wolf. i believe a poster called this character the big bad wolf, but he isn't that, even if he's technically based on him (he's actually death). every one of these villains are unique with their own motivations. every minute makes me eager to find out what happens next.so...who does get the wish in the end? nobody! everyone (except big jack horner) realizes they had what they wanted after awhile. it even begins with another sequel hook with puss in boots going back to far far away land. another shrek/puss in boots movie? if it has such amazing cel shading animation with the best cgi of all, it deserves as many films as possible! ****"
"2757","joker","3xhcch",2022-12-08,8," a darker dreamworks
","puss in boots (antonio banderas) becomes a popular folk hero in his country. after his latest conquest of a giant monster, he was killed by a freak accident with a church bell. when he woke up, puss realized that he already spent eight of his nine lives, and that he only had one more life to live. at first he did not think it was a big deal, but a traumatic encounter with a sinister-looking wolf (wagner moura) made puss decide to retire from adventures.while living the life of a spoiled lazy lap cat, puss learned about a wishing star from the family of goldilocks (florence pugh) and the three bears (ray winstone, olivia colman and samson kayo) who were looking for it. puss decided to search for the star himself in order to wish for his nine lives back. along with puss on his quest were his old flame kitty softpaws (selma hayek) and a nameless little orphan therapy dog (harvey guillen).this sequel to the first ""puss in boots"" solo spin-off movie came out 11 years after the original. there is a very evident difference that can be noted in the style of its animation. on top of the 3d computer-generated images of the characters, there is now an additional 2d artistic style as if they were hand-painted (first seen in ""the bad guys""), especially noted most prominently in the character of the wolf, and even in puss during their showdown fight scenes.the voice work of the actors really captured the personalities of the characters. antonio banderas's voice had the bravado, arrogance and charisma of puss, whom we've known and loved since he made his first appearance in ""shrek 2"" (2004). selma hayek lends her sexy sassiness to the voice of the skillful thief kitty softpaws, who held a grudge against puss. florence pugh's characteristic raspiness was easily recognizable in goldilocks's voice.like before, the characters puss encounters were all fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters. the choice for main antagonist was jack horner, the boy who sat in the corner eating his pies, but he was not little here anymore. he was not as famous as others, so some kids may need a review of his rhyme to refamiliarize. there were a trove of disney character references you'll have fun identifying, from mary poppins, alice in wonderland and jiminy cricket.very notable in this latest dreamworks release is the darkness of the plot, which was also reflected in the artwork styles and situations depicted. only in trickles, but this must be the first time blood was seen in a dreamworks animated film. the language and humor used was also more mature, even with some assumed expletives bleeped out. as the topic of death played a major part in the story, scenes with the wolf can be very scary for little kids. 8/10.ps: the new dreamworks animation opening logo precedes this film. it was quite nostalgic to see the dreamworks boy seeing famous dreamworks characters old an new -- like toothless, po, boss baby, a troll, the bad guys and of course, shrek with fiona and donkey -- as his crescent moon flew him around in space before settling in its place."

","this is genuinely one of my favorite films of the year. i hope it gets real recognition and people don't dismiss it as ""just an animated film"".i've always liked dreamworks films, with my favorite being how to train your dragon 2, but after rewatching the first puss in boots movie, i wasn't expecting much for this sequel, eleven years after. i like the first installment for sure but it's certainly a lot simpler in story than i'd prefer. this one however, has such a rich emotional aspect to it that i truly felt something during it.there were also certain scenes involving a wolf character that were quite creepy. i think kids will have a lot of fun with this movie, but at the core this is a story about family and understanding the value of things and/or people who are in front of you already. and that's a message that every person of any age can get something out of. the voice acting is top-notch and the animation is such a ridiculous step-up from the last time. this is such a cool direction to take this sequel into and i dug it all the way through.there's really not much negative to say other than the ending feels like it should have been slightly more concise, but that's it. i loved it and i'll rewatch it as soon as it releases on vod."

","i did not have many expectations going into this with my daughter, i've seen the main shrek movies but noon of the other puss in boot's spin-offs. i was shocked at how good a movie this was when the credits rolled!the story itself is functional, but all characters are given meaningful and relatable arcs. between the melanchonic puss reaching the end of his days as a great hero, his always positive dog sidekick and the 3 antagonistic parties trying to reach the magical macguffin there is a lot going on and none of it feels forced in.the two greatest assets the movie brings is it's humor and the stunning action scenes. first of all, this movie has bite, it is back to the tone of the first shrek movie with lots of jokes that are working on a children and adult level of understanding. while the story is easy to follow for kids, the themes explored are relatively mature and will keep adults engaged.secondly, while disney/pixar movies lately fail to make action exiting with their polished cgi style, puss in boots goes full into the spiderverse once a fight breaks out. glorious 12 frames per second, hyper stylized with all the filters and gimmicks necessary to elevate the big set-pieces to something truly special and memorable. especially puss's duels against a mysterious bounty hunter are the highlights.while not entirely original, the puss in boots: the last wish combines the edgy humor of shrek with the visual wonders of into the spiderverse and strings it along a relatively matured heroes journey coming to it's end tale that is closer to logan than any other animation i can think off. oh and just in case (not that i personally care much about it) there is zero political agenda to be found here to be a distraction of the perception."

","in an age when movie and tv franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (i'm looking at you, disney), i don't think anyone was expecting much from puss in boots: the last wish - certainly not i.after the first 5 minutes, i knew this was something special.firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from arkane and enter the spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. the 2d elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.the music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).the dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling i think i've ever seen. in a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. the cast do a great job of selling them too. goldi and the bears come out with brilliant british-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.and then there's the wolf. this character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. his style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, i'm serious).at a time when disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - dreamworks have taken on the mantle.it made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. you might think i'm overselling it, but hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.there are those that say that hollywood is done - i know i do. but dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

-jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.adorable characters/feel
-new characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-the feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-has that element of shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.the animation
-it's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy dreamworks does so well.-the design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-the world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that i certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-and it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than disney for the blend of real and cartoons.the voice acting:
-many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that snl like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. he own the horner character and brought some of the best lines.-wagner moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the big-bad wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-pugh is okay, not my favorite role as goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. it does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-banderas takes boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the spanish stereotype. and yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.the references/jokes
-the stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of shrek.-it's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-the fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-it feels like the first two shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. again, refreshing that they were able to step back.the designs changes to an extent
-creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-like into the spiderverse? good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that puss does.-not overused, which is very good for me.the action at times
-shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-this movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-the ending fight shows the potential of what dreamworks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes i've seen this year.the heart
-lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-the movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-there are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. that's hard to do in many things.-i love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-have not felt this way since shrek 2.dislikes:the darkness
-it's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.predictable
-the lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-the movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.too many antagonists
-one of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-they do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.the comedy is still tapered
-it's starting to go back to shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made shrek, shrek.-they took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.the animation changes at times
-the animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-the comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.the action still not complete
--shrek and shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-this movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-the stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-they sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-often was shorter than i wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.the verdict
i must say, puss in boots: the last wish was a much better film than when i walked in. perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. it evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. and it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. this film is indeed a solid return to the world and i had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. however, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance i was looking for. the movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with puss in boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. and the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the shrek that we saw in the first two movies. still, i do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

","i did not expect the sequel to a decent spin-off dreamworks film from over a decade ago to be one of the most poignant, introspective, genuinely hilarious, and heartwarming films of the year. but here we are.after an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, the last wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. the film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.the screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. and it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.what i also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.i adored this film. i think it's dreamworks' best film since megamind and it's easily the best true family film of the year."

","""puss in boots: the last wish"" is as spry and light on its feet as its titular feline. the inherently alluring paradox of the swashbuckling kitty from the ""shrek"" universe remains firmly in place 11 years after his first solo feature. he's a dashing adventurer, a charmer with the ladies, feared and renowned throughout the land -- but he's also unbearably adorable as he laps up milk from a shot glass with his pinky, sandpapery tongue. as always, the charismatic and sensitive antonio banderas finds just the right tone in exploring this furry animated figure's suave and silly sides. ""the last wish"" expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the oscar-nominated 2011 original ""puss in boots."" joining banderas and his longtime friend and co-star salma hayek pinault are florence pugh, olivia colman, ray winstone, da'vine joy randolph, and john mulaney, among many others. they bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor. but of course, the fast-paced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director joel crawford and co-director januel mercado's film. the film's aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences, especially during the action sequences, but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight. from the moss growing on a fearsome forest giant to the shiny silkiness of puss' whiskers blowing in the wind, ""the last wish"" offers a variety of eye-popping details. and it frequently features dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves to transition from past to present or one scene to the next. but the film also manages to convey messages of selflessness and teamwork in a way that doesn't feel heavy-handed or cloying. and the stellar voice performances and dazzling visuals keep things so engaging you won't need a laser pointer or a catnip-stuffed mouse toy to entertain you."

","the last ""puss in boots"" movie was made 11 years ago, as well as the last film the ""shrek"" franchise, so surely they couldn't make something really great again, right? the story is pretty standard, as puss in boots is down to his last life and tries to get a wish on a magic star. it seriously has some of the best action i've seen in a long time. i don't even think this film qualifies as a comedy. it really is more like a straightforward action flick. even its first five minutes are nothing but nonstop action from frame 1 to frame...whatever.this film does not take place before the shrek films. we get to see some brief flashbacks with shrek himself, albeit only for a few seconds. the villains are big jack horner, goldilocks and the three bears, and a wolf. i believe a poster called this character the big bad wolf, but he isn't that, even if he's technically based on him (he's actually death). every one of these villains are unique with their own motivations. every minute makes me eager to find out what happens next.so...who does get the wish in the end? nobody! everyone (except big jack horner) realizes they had what they wanted after awhile. it even begins with another sequel hook with puss in boots going back to far far away land. another shrek/puss in boots movie? if it has such amazing cel shading animation with the best cgi of all, it deserves as many films as possible! ****"

","puss in boots (antonio banderas) becomes a popular folk hero in his country. after his latest conquest of a giant monster, he was killed by a freak accident with a church bell. when he woke up, puss realized that he already spent eight of his nine lives, and that he only had one more life to live. at first he did not think it was a big deal, but a traumatic encounter with a sinister-looking wolf (wagner moura) made puss decide to retire from adventures.while living the life of a spoiled lazy lap cat, puss learned about a wishing star from the family of goldilocks (florence pugh) and the three bears (ray winstone, olivia colman and samson kayo) who were looking for it. puss decided to search for the star himself in order to wish for his nine lives back. along with puss on his quest were his old flame kitty softpaws (selma hayek) and a nameless little orphan therapy dog (harvey guillen).this sequel to the first ""puss in boots"" solo spin-off movie came out 11 years after the original. there is a very evident difference that can be noted in the style of its animation. on top of the 3d computer-generated images of the characters, there is now an additional 2d artistic style as if they were hand-painted (first seen in ""the bad guys""), especially noted most prominently in the character of the wolf, and even in puss during their showdown fight scenes.the voice work of the actors really captured the personalities of the characters. antonio banderas's voice had the bravado, arrogance and charisma of puss, whom we've known and loved since he made his first appearance in ""shrek 2"" (2004). selma hayek lends her sexy sassiness to the voice of the skillful thief kitty softpaws, who held a grudge against puss. florence pugh's characteristic raspiness was easily recognizable in goldilocks's voice.like before, the characters puss encounters were all fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters. the choice for main antagonist was jack horner, the boy who sat in the corner eating his pies, but he was not little here anymore. he was not as famous as others, so some kids may need a review of his rhyme to refamiliarize. there were a trove of disney character references you'll have fun identifying, from mary poppins, alice in wonderland and jiminy cricket.very notable in this latest dreamworks release is the darkness of the plot, which was also reflected in the artwork styles and situations depicted. only in trickles, but this must be the first time blood was seen in a dreamworks animated film. the language and humor used was also more mature, even with some assumed expletives bleeped out. as the topic of death played a major part in the story, scenes with the wolf can be very scary for little kids. 8/10.ps: the new dreamworks animation opening logo precedes this film. it was quite nostalgic to see the dreamworks boy seeing famous dreamworks characters old an new -- like toothless, po, boss baby, a troll, the bad guys and of course, shrek with fiona and donkey -- as his crescent moon flew him around in space before settling in its place."

","i did not have many expectations going into this with my daughter, i've seen the main shrek movies but noon of the other puss in boot's spin-offs. i was shocked at how good a movie this was when the credits rolled!the story itself is functional, but all characters are given meaningful and relatable arcs. between the melanchonic puss reaching the end of his days as a great hero, his always positive dog sidekick and the 3 antagonistic parties trying to reach the magical macguffin there is a lot going on and none of it feels forced in.the two greatest assets the movie brings is it's humor and the stunning action scenes. first of all, this movie has bite, it is back to the tone of the first shrek movie with lots of jokes that are working on a children and adult level of understanding. while the story is easy to follow for kids, the themes explored are relatively mature and will keep adults engaged.secondly, while disney/pixar movies lately fail to make action exiting with their polished cgi style, puss in boots goes full into the spiderverse once a fight breaks out. glorious 12 frames per second, hyper stylized with all the filters and gimmicks necessary to elevate the big set-pieces to something truly special and memorable. especially puss's duels against a mysterious bounty hunter are the highlights.while not entirely original, the puss in boots: the last wish combines the edgy humor of shrek with the visual wonders of into the spiderverse and strings it along a relatively matured heroes journey coming to it's end tale that is closer to logan than any other animation i can think off. oh and just in case (not that i personally care much about it) there is zero political agenda to be found here to be a distraction of the perception."

-many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that snl like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. he own the horner character and brought some of the best lines.-wagner moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the big-bad wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-pugh is okay, not my favorite role as goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. it does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-banderas takes boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the spanish stereotype. and yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.the references/jokes
-the stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of shrek.-it's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-the fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-it feels like the first two shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. again, refreshing that they were able to step back.the designs changes to an extent
-creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-like into the spiderverse? good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that puss does.-not overused, which is very good for me.the action at times
-shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-this movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-the ending fight shows the potential of what dreamworks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes i've seen this year.the heart
-lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-the movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-there are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. that's hard to do in many things.-i love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-have not felt this way since shrek 2.dislikes:the darkness
-it's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.predictable
-the lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-the movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.too many antagonists
-one of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-they do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.the comedy is still tapered
-it's starting to go back to shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made shrek, shrek.-they took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.the animation changes at times
-the animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-the comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.the action still not complete
--shrek and shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-this movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-the stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-they sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-often was shorter than i wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.the verdict
i must say, puss in boots: the last wish was a much better film than when i walked in. perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. it evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. and it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. this film is indeed a solid return to the world and i had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. however, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance i was looking for. the movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with puss in boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. and the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the shrek that we saw in the first two movies. still, i do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

","i did not expect the sequel to a decent spin-off dreamworks film from over a decade ago to be one of the most poignant, introspective, genuinely hilarious, and heartwarming films of the year. but here we are.after an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, the last wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. the film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.the screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. and it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.what i also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.i adored this film. i think it's dreamworks' best film since megamind and it's easily the best true family film of the year."

","""puss in boots: the last wish"" is as spry and light on its feet as its titular feline. the inherently alluring paradox of the swashbuckling kitty from the ""shrek"" universe remains firmly in place 11 years after his first solo feature. he's a dashing adventurer, a charmer with the ladies, feared and renowned throughout the land -- but he's also unbearably adorable as he laps up milk from a shot glass with his pinky, sandpapery tongue. as always, the charismatic and sensitive antonio banderas finds just the right tone in exploring this furry animated figure's suave and silly sides. ""the last wish"" expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the oscar-nominated 2011 original ""puss in boots."" joining banderas and his longtime friend and co-star salma hayek pinault are florence pugh, olivia colman, ray winstone, da'vine joy randolph, and john mulaney, among many others. they bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor. but of course, the fast-paced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director joel crawford and co-director januel mercado's film. the film's aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences, especially during the action sequences, but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight. from the moss growing on a fearsome forest giant to the shiny silkiness of puss' whiskers blowing in the wind, ""the last wish"" offers a variety of eye-popping details. and it frequently features dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves to transition from past to present or one scene to the next. but the film also manages to convey messages of selflessness and teamwork in a way that doesn't feel heavy-handed or cloying. and the stellar voice performances and dazzling visuals keep things so engaging you won't need a laser pointer or a catnip-stuffed mouse toy to entertain you."

","the last ""puss in boots"" movie was made 11 years ago, as well as the last film the ""shrek"" franchise, so surely they couldn't make something really great again, right? the story is pretty standard, as puss in boots is down to his last life and tries to get a wish on a magic star. it seriously has some of the best action i've seen in a long time. i don't even think this film qualifies as a comedy. it really is more like a straightforward action flick. even its first five minutes are nothing but nonstop action from frame 1 to frame...whatever.this film does not take place before the shrek films. we get to see some brief flashbacks with shrek himself, albeit only for a few seconds. the villains are big jack horner, goldilocks and the three bears, and a wolf. i believe a poster called this character the big bad wolf, but he isn't that, even if he's technically based on him (he's actually death). every one of these villains are unique with their own motivations. every minute makes me eager to find out what happens next.so...who does get the wish in the end? nobody! everyone (except big jack horner) realizes they had what they wanted after awhile. it even begins with another sequel hook with puss in boots going back to far far away land. another shrek/puss in boots movie? if it has such amazing cel shading animation with the best cgi of all, it deserves as many films as possible! ****"
"2807","joker","3xhcch",2022-12-08,8," a darker dreamworks
","puss in boots (antonio banderas) becomes a popular folk hero in his country. after his latest conquest of a giant monster, he was killed by a freak accident with a church bell. when he woke up, puss realized that he already spent eight of his nine lives, and that he only had one more life to live. at first he did not think it was a big deal, but a traumatic encounter with a sinister-looking wolf (wagner moura) made puss decide to retire from adventures.while living the life of a spoiled lazy lap cat, puss learned about a wishing star from the family of goldilocks (florence pugh) and the three bears (ray winstone, olivia colman and samson kayo) who were looking for it. puss decided to search for the star himself in order to wish for his nine lives back. along with puss on his quest were his old flame kitty softpaws (selma hayek) and a nameless little orphan therapy dog (harvey guillen).this sequel to the first ""puss in boots"" solo spin-off movie came out 11 years after the original. there is a very evident difference that can be noted in the style of its animation. on top of the 3d computer-generated images of the characters, there is now an additional 2d artistic style as if they were hand-painted (first seen in ""the bad guys""), especially noted most prominently in the character of the wolf, and even in puss during their showdown fight scenes.the voice work of the actors really captured the personalities of the characters. antonio banderas's voice had the bravado, arrogance and charisma of puss, whom we've known and loved since he made his first appearance in ""shrek 2"" (2004). selma hayek lends her sexy sassiness to the voice of the skillful thief kitty softpaws, who held a grudge against puss. florence pugh's characteristic raspiness was easily recognizable in goldilocks's voice.like before, the characters puss encounters were all fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters. the choice for main antagonist was jack horner, the boy who sat in the corner eating his pies, but he was not little here anymore. he was not as famous as others, so some kids may need a review of his rhyme to refamiliarize. there were a trove of disney character references you'll have fun identifying, from mary poppins, alice in wonderland and jiminy cricket.very notable in this latest dreamworks release is the darkness of the plot, which was also reflected in the artwork styles and situations depicted. only in trickles, but this must be the first time blood was seen in a dreamworks animated film. the language and humor used was also more mature, even with some assumed expletives bleeped out. as the topic of death played a major part in the story, scenes with the wolf can be very scary for little kids. 8/10.ps: the new dreamworks animation opening logo precedes this film. it was quite nostalgic to see the dreamworks boy seeing famous dreamworks characters old an new -- like toothless, po, boss baby, a troll, the bad guys and of course, shrek with fiona and donkey -- as his crescent moon flew him around in space before settling in its place."

","this is genuinely one of my favorite films of the year. i hope it gets real recognition and people don't dismiss it as ""just an animated film"".i've always liked dreamworks films, with my favorite being how to train your dragon 2, but after rewatching the first puss in boots movie, i wasn't expecting much for this sequel, eleven years after. i like the first installment for sure but it's certainly a lot simpler in story than i'd prefer. this one however, has such a rich emotional aspect to it that i truly felt something during it.there were also certain scenes involving a wolf character that were quite creepy. i think kids will have a lot of fun with this movie, but at the core this is a story about family and understanding the value of things and/or people who are in front of you already. and that's a message that every person of any age can get something out of. the voice acting is top-notch and the animation is such a ridiculous step-up from the last time. this is such a cool direction to take this sequel into and i dug it all the way through.there's really not much negative to say other than the ending feels like it should have been slightly more concise, but that's it. i loved it and i'll rewatch it as soon as it releases on vod."

","i did not have many expectations going into this with my daughter, i've seen the main shrek movies but noon of the other puss in boot's spin-offs. i was shocked at how good a movie this was when the credits rolled!the story itself is functional, but all characters are given meaningful and relatable arcs. between the melanchonic puss reaching the end of his days as a great hero, his always positive dog sidekick and the 3 antagonistic parties trying to reach the magical macguffin there is a lot going on and none of it feels forced in.the two greatest assets the movie brings is it's humor and the stunning action scenes. first of all, this movie has bite, it is back to the tone of the first shrek movie with lots of jokes that are working on a children and adult level of understanding. while the story is easy to follow for kids, the themes explored are relatively mature and will keep adults engaged.secondly, while disney/pixar movies lately fail to make action exiting with their polished cgi style, puss in boots goes full into the spiderverse once a fight breaks out. glorious 12 frames per second, hyper stylized with all the filters and gimmicks necessary to elevate the big set-pieces to something truly special and memorable. especially puss's duels against a mysterious bounty hunter are the highlights.while not entirely original, the puss in boots: the last wish combines the edgy humor of shrek with the visual wonders of into the spiderverse and strings it along a relatively matured heroes journey coming to it's end tale that is closer to logan than any other animation i can think off. oh and just in case (not that i personally care much about it) there is zero political agenda to be found here to be a distraction of the perception."

","in an age when movie and tv franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (i'm looking at you, disney), i don't think anyone was expecting much from puss in boots: the last wish - certainly not i.after the first 5 minutes, i knew this was something special.firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from arkane and enter the spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. the 2d elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.the music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).the dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling i think i've ever seen. in a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. the cast do a great job of selling them too. goldi and the bears come out with brilliant british-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.and then there's the wolf. this character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. his style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, i'm serious).at a time when disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - dreamworks have taken on the mantle.it made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. you might think i'm overselling it, but hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.there are those that say that hollywood is done - i know i do. but dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

","you heard me! my wife and i just got back from the theater, and absolutely loved this movie, even more than any of the shrek movies and the first puss in boots!this movie has so much to love, from beautiful visuals/action to consistent humor that actually had us laughing to engaging characters, both old and new. such a fun time, and so worth seeing in the theaters, though we'll definitely be picking up a copy once it's out on dvd!without giving too much away, there are several different antagonists in this movie that scratch all the bad-guy itches, covering the spectrum from totally hateable to horrifying to relatable and sympathetic. a great cast! also, the magical world they came up with for this movie was awesome, with some really cool/unique features!at first, we were a little worried about the dog character, neither of us being big fans of daffy sidekicks, but we were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves rooting for him! he's hilarious, and that's coming from a cat-lover!several callbacks to the first puss in boots movie made this one feel less like a spin-off than a worthy standalone franchise, and the movie was packed with magical references that all ages will be able to recognize and enjoy.do yourself a favor and free a few hours for this one!! a rare 10 from me!!"

","likes:pacing
-very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.adorable characters/feel
-new characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-the feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-has that element of shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.the animation
-it's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy dreamworks does so well.-the design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-the world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that i certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-and it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than disney for the blend of real and cartoons.the voice acting:
-many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that snl like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. he own the horner character and brought some of the best lines.-wagner moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the big-bad wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-pugh is okay, not my favorite role as goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. it does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-banderas takes boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the spanish stereotype. and yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.the references/jokes
-the stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of shrek.-it's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-the fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-it feels like the first two shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. again, refreshing that they were able to step back.the designs changes to an extent
-creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-like into the spiderverse? good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that puss does.-not overused, which is very good for me.the action at times
-shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-this movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-the ending fight shows the potential of what dreamworks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes i've seen this year.the heart
-lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-the movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-there are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. that's hard to do in many things.-i love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-have not felt this way since shrek 2.dislikes:the darkness
-it's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.predictable
-the lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-the movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.too many antagonists
-one of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-they do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.the comedy is still tapered
-it's starting to go back to shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made shrek, shrek.-they took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.the animation changes at times
-the animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-the comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.the action still not complete
--shrek and shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-this movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-the stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-they sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-often was shorter than i wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.the verdict
i must say, puss in boots: the last wish was a much better film than when i walked in. perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. it evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. and it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. this film is indeed a solid return to the world and i had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. however, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance i was looking for. the movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with puss in boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. and the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the shrek that we saw in the first two movies. still, i do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

","i did not expect the sequel to a decent spin-off dreamworks film from over a decade ago to be one of the most poignant, introspective, genuinely hilarious, and heartwarming films of the year. but here we are.after an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, the last wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. the film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.the screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. and it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.what i also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.i adored this film. i think it's dreamworks' best film since megamind and it's easily the best true family film of the year."

","""puss in boots: the last wish"" is as spry and light on its feet as its titular feline. the inherently alluring paradox of the swashbuckling kitty from the ""shrek"" universe remains firmly in place 11 years after his first solo feature. he's a dashing adventurer, a charmer with the ladies, feared and renowned throughout the land -- but he's also unbearably adorable as he laps up milk from a shot glass with his pinky, sandpapery tongue. as always, the charismatic and sensitive antonio banderas finds just the right tone in exploring this furry animated figure's suave and silly sides. ""the last wish"" expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the oscar-nominated 2011 original ""puss in boots."" joining banderas and his longtime friend and co-star salma hayek pinault are florence pugh, olivia colman, ray winstone, da'vine joy randolph, and john mulaney, among many others. they bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor. but of course, the fast-paced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director joel crawford and co-director januel mercado's film. the film's aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences, especially during the action sequences, but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight. from the moss growing on a fearsome forest giant to the shiny silkiness of puss' whiskers blowing in the wind, ""the last wish"" offers a variety of eye-popping details. and it frequently features dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves to transition from past to present or one scene to the next. but the film also manages to convey messages of selflessness and teamwork in a way that doesn't feel heavy-handed or cloying. and the stellar voice performances and dazzling visuals keep things so engaging you won't need a laser pointer or a catnip-stuffed mouse toy to entertain you."

","the last ""puss in boots"" movie was made 11 years ago, as well as the last film the ""shrek"" franchise, so surely they couldn't make something really great again, right? the story is pretty standard, as puss in boots is down to his last life and tries to get a wish on a magic star. it seriously has some of the best action i've seen in a long time. i don't even think this film qualifies as a comedy. it really is more like a straightforward action flick. even its first five minutes are nothing but nonstop action from frame 1 to frame...whatever.this film does not take place before the shrek films. we get to see some brief flashbacks with shrek himself, albeit only for a few seconds. the villains are big jack horner, goldilocks and the three bears, and a wolf. i believe a poster called this character the big bad wolf, but he isn't that, even if he's technically based on him (he's actually death). every one of these villains are unique with their own motivations. every minute makes me eager to find out what happens next.so...who does get the wish in the end? nobody! everyone (except big jack horner) realizes they had what they wanted after awhile. it even begins with another sequel hook with puss in boots going back to far far away land. another shrek/puss in boots movie? if it has such amazing cel shading animation with the best cgi of all, it deserves as many films as possible! ****"

","puss in boots (antonio banderas) becomes a popular folk hero in his country. after his latest conquest of a giant monster, he was killed by a freak accident with a church bell. when he woke up, puss realized that he already spent eight of his nine lives, and that he only had one more life to live. at first he did not think it was a big deal, but a traumatic encounter with a sinister-looking wolf (wagner moura) made puss decide to retire from adventures.while living the life of a spoiled lazy lap cat, puss learned about a wishing star from the family of goldilocks (florence pugh) and the three bears (ray winstone, olivia colman and samson kayo) who were looking for it. puss decided to search for the star himself in order to wish for his nine lives back. along with puss on his quest were his old flame kitty softpaws (selma hayek) and a nameless little orphan therapy dog (harvey guillen).this sequel to the first ""puss in boots"" solo spin-off movie came out 11 years after the original. there is a very evident difference that can be noted in the style of its animation. on top of the 3d computer-generated images of the characters, there is now an additional 2d artistic style as if they were hand-painted (first seen in ""the bad guys""), especially noted most prominently in the character of the wolf, and even in puss during their showdown fight scenes.the voice work of the actors really captured the personalities of the characters. antonio banderas's voice had the bravado, arrogance and charisma of puss, whom we've known and loved since he made his first appearance in ""shrek 2"" (2004). selma hayek lends her sexy sassiness to the voice of the skillful thief kitty softpaws, who held a grudge against puss. florence pugh's characteristic raspiness was easily recognizable in goldilocks's voice.like before, the characters puss encounters were all fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters. the choice for main antagonist was jack horner, the boy who sat in the corner eating his pies, but he was not little here anymore. he was not as famous as others, so some kids may need a review of his rhyme to refamiliarize. there were a trove of disney character references you'll have fun identifying, from mary poppins, alice in wonderland and jiminy cricket.very notable in this latest dreamworks release is the darkness of the plot, which was also reflected in the artwork styles and situations depicted. only in trickles, but this must be the first time blood was seen in a dreamworks animated film. the language and humor used was also more mature, even with some assumed expletives bleeped out. as the topic of death played a major part in the story, scenes with the wolf can be very scary for little kids. 8/10.ps: the new dreamworks animation opening logo precedes this film. it was quite nostalgic to see the dreamworks boy seeing famous dreamworks characters old an new -- like toothless, po, boss baby, a troll, the bad guys and of course, shrek with fiona and donkey -- as his crescent moon flew him around in space before settling in its place."

","i did not have many expectations going into this with my daughter, i've seen the main shrek movies but noon of the other puss in boot's spin-offs. i was shocked at how good a movie this was when the credits rolled!the story itself is functional, but all characters are given meaningful and relatable arcs. between the melanchonic puss reaching the end of his days as a great hero, his always positive dog sidekick and the 3 antagonistic parties trying to reach the magical macguffin there is a lot going on and none of it feels forced in.the two greatest assets the movie brings is it's humor and the stunning action scenes. first of all, this movie has bite, it is back to the tone of the first shrek movie with lots of jokes that are working on a children and adult level of understanding. while the story is easy to follow for kids, the themes explored are relatively mature and will keep adults engaged.secondly, while disney/pixar movies lately fail to make action exiting with their polished cgi style, puss in boots goes full into the spiderverse once a fight breaks out. glorious 12 frames per second, hyper stylized with all the filters and gimmicks necessary to elevate the big set-pieces to something truly special and memorable. especially puss's duels against a mysterious bounty hunter are the highlights.while not entirely original, the puss in boots: the last wish combines the edgy humor of shrek with the visual wonders of into the spiderverse and strings it along a relatively matured heroes journey coming to it's end tale that is closer to logan than any other animation i can think off. oh and just in case (not that i personally care much about it) there is zero political agenda to be found here to be a distraction of the perception."

""sequels to spin-offs of beloved franchises are pointless exercises in brand awareness! why on earth are you giving this one a 10?!?""because this movie...is different than the others. different in that it strives to be a funnier, deeper, prettier, bolder, edgier, (surprisingly) scarier and overall more complete experience than the original puss in boots film over 11 years ago, and unlike that movie holds a distinct accomplishment in simply being a darn fine animated film that stands on its own, one as good as any i've seen in the past few years.the shrekiverse is officially back, and judging by what dreamworks managed to pull off here the world probably isn't ready for whatever comes next. seriously, this gives the first two films in the franchise alone a run for their money.looks like the house that shrek built is finally back on top again.ps: that cricket with the spot-on jimmy stewart voice is one of the funniest things i've seen this year, whoever came up with him deserves a pay raise and a medal and free coffee and recognition from the united nations."

","""puss in boots: the last wish"" is a most unusual cgi film from dreamworks. this is because although kids might like it, it's clearly intended for adults. after all, the film has very strong existential elements....things that would be mostly lost on kids.this film starts with the usual self-assured heroism you would expect in a puss in boots cartoon. but then something most unusual happens...after defying death again and again, puss suddenly realizes his own mortality, as he realizes he's used up eight of his nine lives...and soon he will die once and for all! as a result, he's now afraid to be his old dashing self. so, he goes off in search of some magical wish...in the hopes that he can regain his previous lives. but, not surprisingly, along the way he discovers so much more.the animation is lovely and the story quite enjoyable. there really isn't much to complain about with this story...it's well made and hard not to like. it also is amazingly deep and unusual...not the usual vacuous sequel just made to capitalize on the original film's success."

","in an age when movie and tv franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (i'm looking at you, disney), i don't think anyone was expecting much from puss in boots: the last wish - certainly not i.after the first 5 minutes, i knew this was something special.firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from arkane and enter the spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. the 2d elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.the music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).the dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling i think i've ever seen. in a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. the cast do a great job of selling them too. goldi and the bears come out with brilliant british-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.and then there's the wolf. this character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. his style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, i'm serious).at a time when disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - dreamworks have taken on the mantle.it made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. you might think i'm overselling it, but hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.there are those that say that hollywood is done - i know i do. but dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

-very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.adorable characters/feel
-new characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-the feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-has that element of shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.the animation
-it's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy dreamworks does so well.-the design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-the world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that i certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-and it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than disney for the blend of real and cartoons.the voice acting:
-many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that snl like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. he own the horner character and brought some of the best lines.-wagner moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the big-bad wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-pugh is okay, not my favorite role as goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. it does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-banderas takes boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the spanish stereotype. and yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.the references/jokes
-the stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of shrek.-it's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-the fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-it feels like the first two shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. again, refreshing that they were able to step back.the designs changes to an extent
-creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-like into the spiderverse? good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that puss does.-not overused, which is very good for me.the action at times
-shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-this movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-the ending fight shows the potential of what dreamworks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes i've seen this year.the heart
-lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-the movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-there are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. that's hard to do in many things.-i love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-have not felt this way since shrek 2.dislikes:the darkness
-it's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.predictable
-the lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-the movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.too many antagonists
-one of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-they do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.the comedy is still tapered
-it's starting to go back to shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made shrek, shrek.-they took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.the animation changes at times
-the animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-the comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.the action still not complete
--shrek and shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-this movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-the stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-they sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-often was shorter than i wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.the verdict
i must say, puss in boots: the last wish was a much better film than when i walked in. perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. it evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. and it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. this film is indeed a solid return to the world and i had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. however, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance i was looking for. the movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with puss in boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. and the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the shrek that we saw in the first two movies. still, i do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."
"2851","joker","benjaminskylerhill",2022-12-22,10," yeah, it's that good.
","i did not expect the sequel to a decent spin-off dreamworks film from over a decade ago to be one of the most poignant, introspective, genuinely hilarious, and heartwarming films of the year. but here we are.after an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, the last wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. the film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.the screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. and it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.what i also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.i adored this film. i think it's dreamworks' best film since megamind and it's easily the best true family film of the year."

","""puss in boots: the last wish"" is as spry and light on its feet as its titular feline. the inherently alluring paradox of the swashbuckling kitty from the ""shrek"" universe remains firmly in place 11 years after his first solo feature. he's a dashing adventurer, a charmer with the ladies, feared and renowned throughout the land -- but he's also unbearably adorable as he laps up milk from a shot glass with his pinky, sandpapery tongue. as always, the charismatic and sensitive antonio banderas finds just the right tone in exploring this furry animated figure's suave and silly sides. ""the last wish"" expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the oscar-nominated 2011 original ""puss in boots."" joining banderas and his longtime friend and co-star salma hayek pinault are florence pugh, olivia colman, ray winstone, da'vine joy randolph, and john mulaney, among many others. they bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor. but of course, the fast-paced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director joel crawford and co-director januel mercado's film. the film's aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences, especially during the action sequences, but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight. from the moss growing on a fearsome forest giant to the shiny silkiness of puss' whiskers blowing in the wind, ""the last wish"" offers a variety of eye-popping details. and it frequently features dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves to transition from past to present or one scene to the next. but the film also manages to convey messages of selflessness and teamwork in a way that doesn't feel heavy-handed or cloying. and the stellar voice performances and dazzling visuals keep things so engaging you won't need a laser pointer or a catnip-stuffed mouse toy to entertain you."

","the last ""puss in boots"" movie was made 11 years ago, as well as the last film the ""shrek"" franchise, so surely they couldn't make something really great again, right? the story is pretty standard, as puss in boots is down to his last life and tries to get a wish on a magic star. it seriously has some of the best action i've seen in a long time. i don't even think this film qualifies as a comedy. it really is more like a straightforward action flick. even its first five minutes are nothing but nonstop action from frame 1 to frame...whatever.this film does not take place before the shrek films. we get to see some brief flashbacks with shrek himself, albeit only for a few seconds. the villains are big jack horner, goldilocks and the three bears, and a wolf. i believe a poster called this character the big bad wolf, but he isn't that, even if he's technically based on him (he's actually death). every one of these villains are unique with their own motivations. every minute makes me eager to find out what happens next.so...who does get the wish in the end? nobody! everyone (except big jack horner) realizes they had what they wanted after awhile. it even begins with another sequel hook with puss in boots going back to far far away land. another shrek/puss in boots movie? if it has such amazing cel shading animation with the best cgi of all, it deserves as many films as possible! ****"

","puss in boots (antonio banderas) becomes a popular folk hero in his country. after his latest conquest of a giant monster, he was killed by a freak accident with a church bell. when he woke up, puss realized that he already spent eight of his nine lives, and that he only had one more life to live. at first he did not think it was a big deal, but a traumatic encounter with a sinister-looking wolf (wagner moura) made puss decide to retire from adventures.while living the life of a spoiled lazy lap cat, puss learned about a wishing star from the family of goldilocks (florence pugh) and the three bears (ray winstone, olivia colman and samson kayo) who were looking for it. puss decided to search for the star himself in order to wish for his nine lives back. along with puss on his quest were his old flame kitty softpaws (selma hayek) and a nameless little orphan therapy dog (harvey guillen).this sequel to the first ""puss in boots"" solo spin-off movie came out 11 years after the original. there is a very evident difference that can be noted in the style of its animation. on top of the 3d computer-generated images of the characters, there is now an additional 2d artistic style as if they were hand-painted (first seen in ""the bad guys""), especially noted most prominently in the character of the wolf, and even in puss during their showdown fight scenes.the voice work of the actors really captured the personalities of the characters. antonio banderas's voice had the bravado, arrogance and charisma of puss, whom we've known and loved since he made his first appearance in ""shrek 2"" (2004). selma hayek lends her sexy sassiness to the voice of the skillful thief kitty softpaws, who held a grudge against puss. florence pugh's characteristic raspiness was easily recognizable in goldilocks's voice.like before, the characters puss encounters were all fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters. the choice for main antagonist was jack horner, the boy who sat in the corner eating his pies, but he was not little here anymore. he was not as famous as others, so some kids may need a review of his rhyme to refamiliarize. there were a trove of disney character references you'll have fun identifying, from mary poppins, alice in wonderland and jiminy cricket.very notable in this latest dreamworks release is the darkness of the plot, which was also reflected in the artwork styles and situations depicted. only in trickles, but this must be the first time blood was seen in a dreamworks animated film. the language and humor used was also more mature, even with some assumed expletives bleeped out. as the topic of death played a major part in the story, scenes with the wolf can be very scary for little kids. 8/10.ps: the new dreamworks animation opening logo precedes this film. it was quite nostalgic to see the dreamworks boy seeing famous dreamworks characters old an new -- like toothless, po, boss baby, a troll, the bad guys and of course, shrek with fiona and donkey -- as his crescent moon flew him around in space before settling in its place."

","i did not have many expectations going into this with my daughter, i've seen the main shrek movies but noon of the other puss in boot's spin-offs. i was shocked at how good a movie this was when the credits rolled!the story itself is functional, but all characters are given meaningful and relatable arcs. between the melanchonic puss reaching the end of his days as a great hero, his always positive dog sidekick and the 3 antagonistic parties trying to reach the magical macguffin there is a lot going on and none of it feels forced in.the two greatest assets the movie brings is it's humor and the stunning action scenes. first of all, this movie has bite, it is back to the tone of the first shrek movie with lots of jokes that are working on a children and adult level of understanding. while the story is easy to follow for kids, the themes explored are relatively mature and will keep adults engaged.secondly, while disney/pixar movies lately fail to make action exiting with their polished cgi style, puss in boots goes full into the spiderverse once a fight breaks out. glorious 12 frames per second, hyper stylized with all the filters and gimmicks necessary to elevate the big set-pieces to something truly special and memorable. especially puss's duels against a mysterious bounty hunter are the highlights.while not entirely original, the puss in boots: the last wish combines the edgy humor of shrek with the visual wonders of into the spiderverse and strings it along a relatively matured heroes journey coming to it's end tale that is closer to logan than any other animation i can think off. oh and just in case (not that i personally care much about it) there is zero political agenda to be found here to be a distraction of the perception."

","in an age when movie and tv franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (i'm looking at you, disney), i don't think anyone was expecting much from puss in boots: the last wish - certainly not i.after the first 5 minutes, i knew this was something special.firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from arkane and enter the spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. the 2d elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.the music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).the dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling i think i've ever seen. in a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. the cast do a great job of selling them too. goldi and the bears come out with brilliant british-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.and then there's the wolf. this character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. his style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, i'm serious).at a time when disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - dreamworks have taken on the mantle.it made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. you might think i'm overselling it, but hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.there are those that say that hollywood is done - i know i do. but dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way."

-very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.adorable characters/feel
-new characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-the feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-has that element of shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.the animation
-it's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy dreamworks does so well.-the design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-the world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that i certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-and it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than disney for the blend of real and cartoons.the voice acting:
-many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that snl like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. he own the horner character and brought some of the best lines.-wagner moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the big-bad wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-pugh is okay, not my favorite role as goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. it does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-banderas takes boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the spanish stereotype. and yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.the references/jokes
-the stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of shrek.-it's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-the fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-it feels like the first two shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. again, refreshing that they were able to step back.the designs changes to an extent
-creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-like into the spiderverse? good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that puss does.-not overused, which is very good for me.the action at times
-shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-this movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-the ending fight shows the potential of what dreamworks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes i've seen this year.the heart
-lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-the movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-there are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. that's hard to do in many things.-i love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-have not felt this way since shrek 2.dislikes:the darkness
-it's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.predictable
-the lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-the movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.too many antagonists
-one of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-they do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.the comedy is still tapered
-it's starting to go back to shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made shrek, shrek.-they took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.the animation changes at times
-the animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-the comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.the action still not complete
--shrek and shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-this movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-the stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-they sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-often was shorter than i wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.the verdict
i must say, puss in boots: the last wish was a much better film than when i walked in. perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. it evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. and it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. this film is indeed a solid return to the world and i had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. however, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance i was looking for. the movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with puss in boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. and the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the shrek that we saw in the first two movies. still, i do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things."

","sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. and now, after two features in, i can honestly say that about writer-director emerald fennell. i didn't care much for her debut outing, ""promising young woman"" (2020), and i can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""saltburn."" this alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister oxford student (barry keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy english aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, i couldn't care less. (think ""the killing of a sacred deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) this assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. it's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. what's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of rosamund pike, carey mulligan and richard e. grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. and then there's the excessively hammy performance of keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. in all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do. save your money, and don't waste your time on this vastly overrated release from a vastly overrated filmmaker."
"2880","joker","steveinadelaide",2023-11-24,2," an artful disappointment
","saltburn, directed by emerald fennell (who brought us the excellent a promising young woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the english aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. the film stars barry keoghan as oliver quick, a scholarship student at oxford university, and jacob elordi as felix catton, a charming aristocrat who invites oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, saltburn.saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. it attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. however, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. the film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. oliver, played by keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. felix, played by elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.although fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. the film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. the movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. the movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.the cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. the grandeur of saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. these artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. it's a film that tries to be a critique of the english aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. while it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. it's not a film i'd recommend."

"2882","joker","reelreviewsandrecommendations",2023-12-23,1," oliver quick & the dead
","it is 2006, and scholarship student oliver quick has just arrived at oxford. he doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. after befriending felix catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, oliver finally seems to find his place at the university. invited to the catton family home- saltburn- for the summer holidays, oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.written and directed by emerald fennell, 'saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. fennell's narrative begins with promise. in the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. however, after the action moves to the manor house, saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'the talented mr. ripley, 'teorema' or 'the servant.'those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. one, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? what made this character the way they are? fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, scouse tom ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. felix is exactly like ripley's object of obsession, dickie greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'the ruling class' among them. familiar and lacking in depth, fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during oliver's intermittent narration.throughout the film, fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. she lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. the ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to liam gallagher's 'once,' starring a thankfully clothed eric cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.conversely, linus sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the catton family. he employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. it is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.however, sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does suzie davies' rich production design. textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which sophie canale's costume design and charlotte dirickx's set decoration compounds. in addition, anthony willis's score is stirring. his original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably sophie ellis-bextor's 'murder on the dancefloor'- complement the narrative.barry keoghan stars as oliver, alongside jacob elordi as felix, alison oliver as felix's sister venetia and rosamund pike as felix's mother elspeth. keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. when playing oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with venetia being clearest evidence of this.elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned greenleaf. he impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while pike steals the show as the eccentric elspeth. richard e. grant also stars, as felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while archie madekwe's grating performance as felix's cousin is smug and one-note.in conclusion, emerald fennell's 'saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. while the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star barry keoghan is inconsistent. although rosamund pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have."

","one has to assume 'saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. the copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'brideshead revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate oliver quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian felix at oxford university. after a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, saltburn.the invitation is a mystery since oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. the aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'kind hearts and coronets' and 'talented mr ripley'. oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. the other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end."

(think ""the killing of a sacred deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) this assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. it's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. what's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of rosamund pike, carey mulligan and richard e. grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. and then there's the excessively hammy performance of keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. in all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do. save your money, and don't waste your time on this vastly overrated release from a vastly overrated filmmaker."

","saltburn, directed by emerald fennell (who brought us the excellent a promising young woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the english aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. the film stars barry keoghan as oliver quick, a scholarship student at oxford university, and jacob elordi as felix catton, a charming aristocrat who invites oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, saltburn.saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. it attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. however, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. the film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. oliver, played by keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. felix, played by elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.although fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. the film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. the movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. the movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.the cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. the grandeur of saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. these artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. it's a film that tries to be a critique of the english aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. while it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. it's not a film i'd recommend."

"2907","joker","reelreviewsandrecommendations",2023-12-23,1," oliver quick & the dead
","it is 2006, and scholarship student oliver quick has just arrived at oxford. he doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. after befriending felix catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, oliver finally seems to find his place at the university. invited to the catton family home- saltburn- for the summer holidays, oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.written and directed by emerald fennell, 'saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. fennell's narrative begins with promise. in the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. however, after the action moves to the manor house, saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'the talented mr. ripley, 'teorema' or 'the servant.'those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. one, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? what made this character the way they are? fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, scouse tom ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. felix is exactly like ripley's object of obsession, dickie greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'the ruling class' among them. familiar and lacking in depth, fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during oliver's intermittent narration.throughout the film, fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. she lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. the ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to liam gallagher's 'once,' starring a thankfully clothed eric cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.conversely, linus sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the catton family. he employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. it is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.however, sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does suzie davies' rich production design. textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which sophie canale's costume design and charlotte dirickx's set decoration compounds. in addition, anthony willis's score is stirring. his original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably sophie ellis-bextor's 'murder on the dancefloor'- complement the narrative.barry keoghan stars as oliver, alongside jacob elordi as felix, alison oliver as felix's sister venetia and rosamund pike as felix's mother elspeth. keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. when playing oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with venetia being clearest evidence of this.elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned greenleaf. he impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while pike steals the show as the eccentric elspeth. richard e. grant also stars, as felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while archie madekwe's grating performance as felix's cousin is smug and one-note.in conclusion, emerald fennell's 'saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. while the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star barry keoghan is inconsistent. although rosamund pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have."

","saltburn, directed by emerald fennell (who brought us the excellent a promising young woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the english aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. the film stars barry keoghan as oliver quick, a scholarship student at oxford university, and jacob elordi as felix catton, a charming aristocrat who invites oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, saltburn.saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. it attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. however, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. the film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. oliver, played by keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. felix, played by elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.although fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. the film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. the movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. the movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.the cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. the grandeur of saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. these artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. it's a film that tries to be a critique of the english aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. while it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. it's not a film i'd recommend."

","it is 2006, and scholarship student oliver quick has just arrived at oxford. he doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. after befriending felix catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, oliver finally seems to find his place at the university. invited to the catton family home- saltburn- for the summer holidays, oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.written and directed by emerald fennell, 'saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. fennell's narrative begins with promise. in the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. however, after the action moves to the manor house, saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'the talented mr. ripley, 'teorema' or 'the servant.'those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. one, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? what made this character the way they are? fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, scouse tom ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. felix is exactly like ripley's object of obsession, dickie greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'the ruling class' among them. familiar and lacking in depth, fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during oliver's intermittent narration.throughout the film, fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. she lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. the ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to liam gallagher's 'once,' starring a thankfully clothed eric cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.conversely, linus sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the catton family. he employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. it is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.however, sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does suzie davies' rich production design. textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which sophie canale's costume design and charlotte dirickx's set decoration compounds. in addition, anthony willis's score is stirring. his original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably sophie ellis-bextor's 'murder on the dancefloor'- complement the narrative.barry keoghan stars as oliver, alongside jacob elordi as felix, alison oliver as felix's sister venetia and rosamund pike as felix's mother elspeth. keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. when playing oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with venetia being clearest evidence of this.elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned greenleaf. he impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while pike steals the show as the eccentric elspeth. richard e. grant also stars, as felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while archie madekwe's grating performance as felix's cousin is smug and one-note.in conclusion, emerald fennell's 'saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. while the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star barry keoghan is inconsistent. although rosamund pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have."

","it is 2006, and scholarship student oliver quick has just arrived at oxford. he doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. after befriending felix catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, oliver finally seems to find his place at the university. invited to the catton family home- saltburn- for the summer holidays, oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.written and directed by emerald fennell, 'saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. fennell's narrative begins with promise. in the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. however, after the action moves to the manor house, saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'the talented mr. ripley, 'teorema' or 'the servant.'those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. one, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? what made this character the way they are? fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, scouse tom ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. felix is exactly like ripley's object of obsession, dickie greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'the ruling class' among them. familiar and lacking in depth, fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during oliver's intermittent narration.throughout the film, fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. she lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. the ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to liam gallagher's 'once,' starring a thankfully clothed eric cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.conversely, linus sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the catton family. he employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. it is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.however, sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does suzie davies' rich production design. textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which sophie canale's costume design and charlotte dirickx's set decoration compounds. in addition, anthony willis's score is stirring. his original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably sophie ellis-bextor's 'murder on the dancefloor'- complement the narrative.barry keoghan stars as oliver, alongside jacob elordi as felix, alison oliver as felix's sister venetia and rosamund pike as felix's mother elspeth. keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. when playing oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with venetia being clearest evidence of this.elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned greenleaf. he impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while pike steals the show as the eccentric elspeth. richard e. grant also stars, as felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while archie madekwe's grating performance as felix's cousin is smug and one-note.in conclusion, emerald fennell's 'saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. while the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star barry keoghan is inconsistent. although rosamund pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have."

what made this character the way they are? fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, scouse tom ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. felix is exactly like ripley's object of obsession, dickie greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'the ruling class' among them. familiar and lacking in depth, fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during oliver's intermittent narration.throughout the film, fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. she lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. the ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to liam gallagher's 'once,' starring a thankfully clothed eric cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.conversely, linus sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the catton family. he employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. it is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.however, sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does suzie davies' rich production design. textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which sophie canale's costume design and charlotte dirickx's set decoration compounds. in addition, anthony willis's score is stirring. his original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably sophie ellis-bextor's 'murder on the dancefloor'- complement the narrative.barry keoghan stars as oliver, alongside jacob elordi as felix, alison oliver as felix's sister venetia and rosamund pike as felix's mother elspeth. keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. when playing oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with venetia being clearest evidence of this.elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned greenleaf. he impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while pike steals the show as the eccentric elspeth. richard e. grant also stars, as felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while archie madekwe's grating performance as felix's cousin is smug and one-note.in conclusion, emerald fennell's 'saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. while the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star barry keoghan is inconsistent. although rosamund pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have."

","scouser student oliver (barry keoghan, who is not english but irish) arrives at oxford university where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). despite this he attracts the attention of home counties aristocrat felix (jacob elordi, who is not english but australian/spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where oliver meets felix's family of stereotypical english aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, american cousin (archie madekwe, who is not american but english/nigerian/swiss). at first even more out-of-place than he was at oxford, oliver quickly becomes used to life at saltburn. but for how long will he be welcome there?watching this at the 2023 london film festival, i found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'the talented mr ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'wild things' (1998) and 'the riot club' (2014). despite this, 'saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of oliver drinking bathwater into which felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but i am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer emerald fennell!) i also appreciated that fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. if i have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.the supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are carey mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and paul rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play oliver) as a straight-laced butler. those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. and as for leading man keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'murder on the dance floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film."

","one has to assume 'saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. the copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'brideshead revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate oliver quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian felix at oxford university. after a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, saltburn.the invitation is a mystery since oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. the aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'kind hearts and coronets' and 'talented mr ripley'. oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. the other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end."
